# Features

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distributed NoSQL Database**       | ScyllaDB is a distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of data across multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and scalability through data replication and node independence.        |
| **API-Compatible with Apache Cassandra** | ScyllaDB is fully API-compatible with Apache Cassandra, supporting the same drivers, tools, and CQL language, allowing for easy migration from Cassandra without major changes to applications.          |
| **High-Throughput, Low-Latency Operations** | ScyllaDB offers high performance through a shard-per-core model, providing high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for real-time analytics and handling millions of operations per second.      |
| **Automatic Sharding and Replication** | ScyllaDB automates data sharding and replication across nodes, balancing the load and ensuring high availability and data durability, reducing the need for manual management.                          |
| **Tunable Consistency Levels**       | ScyllaDB offers tunable consistency levels, allowing users to configure the database for strong or eventual consistency, depending on their specific application requirements.                             |
| **Advanced Compaction Strategies**   | ScyllaDB provides advanced compaction strategies to optimize storage and read performance, allowing users to select the best strategy for their workloads.                                               |
| **Lightweight Transactions**         | ScyllaDB supports lightweight transactions for operations requiring linearizable consistency, ideal for scenarios where strict order and consistency are necessary, such as financial transactions.       |
| **Materialized Views**               | ScyllaDB allows the creation of materialized views that automatically update based on changes to a base table, enabling efficient querying and improving read-heavy workload performance.                |
| **Secondary Indexes**                | ScyllaDB supports secondary indexes, enabling users to efficiently query data based on non-primary key columns, providing flexibility for specific query use cases.                                      |
| **Monitoring and Management**        | ScyllaDB integrates with monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana, and provides a web-based interface for cluster management and performance monitoring.                                         |
| **Cloud and Kubernetes Support**     | ScyllaDB supports deployment on major cloud platforms and Kubernetes, making it a flexible choice for cloud-native and containerized environments.                                                       |


| Pros                                         | Cons                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Exceptional performance for read/write operations | Requires careful data modeling for optimal performance |
| Seamless horizontal scalability              | Limited support for complex joins compared to relational databases |
| Efficient resource utilization               | Eventual consistency model may not suit all use cases |
| API compatibility with Cassandra ecosystem   | Relatively new, with a smaller community compared to established databases |
| Self-tuning capabilities reduce operational overhead | Requires specialized knowledge for advanced operations |



## Conclusion

ScyllaDB is a powerful NoSQL database that excels in performance and scalability, handling big data and high loads efficiently. It provides a smooth transition from Apache Cassandra with improved performance, reduces infrastructure costs, and maintains a straightforward setup and operation process.
