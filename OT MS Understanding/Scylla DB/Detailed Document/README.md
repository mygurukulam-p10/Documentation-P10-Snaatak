## Purpose

This proof of concept (POC) aims to demonstrate the capabilities of ScyllaDB, a high-performance NoSQL database that is API-compatible with Apache Cassandra. ScyllaDB is designed to handle big data workloads with high throughput and low latency. This POC will showcase ScyllaDB's installation process, basic operations, and performance characteristics.


## Architecture

ScyllaDB follows a distributed architecture where data is automatically replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and high availability.

# Features

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distributed NoSQL Database**       | ScyllaDB is a distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of data across multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and scalability through data replication and node independence.        |
| **API-Compatible with Apache Cassandra** | ScyllaDB is fully API-compatible with Apache Cassandra, supporting the same drivers, tools, and CQL language, allowing for easy migration from Cassandra without major changes to applications.          |
| **High-Throughput, Low-Latency Operations** | ScyllaDB offers high performance through a shard-per-core model, providing high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for real-time analytics and handling millions of operations per second.      |
| **Automatic Sharding and Replication** | ScyllaDB automates data sharding and replication across nodes, balancing the load and ensuring high availability and data durability, reducing the need for manual management.                          |
| **Tunable Consistency Levels**       | ScyllaDB offers tunable consistency levels, allowing users to configure the database for strong or eventual consistency, depending on their specific application requirements.                             |
| **Advanced Compaction Strategies**   | ScyllaDB provides advanced compaction strategies to optimize storage and read performance, allowing users to select the best strategy for their workloads.                                               |
| **Lightweight Transactions**         | ScyllaDB supports lightweight transactions for operations requiring linearizable consistency, ideal for scenarios where strict order and consistency are necessary, such as financial transactions.       |
| **Materialized Views**               | ScyllaDB allows the creation of materialized views that automatically update based on changes to a base table, enabling efficient querying and improving read-heavy workload performance.                |
| **Secondary Indexes**                | ScyllaDB supports secondary indexes, enabling users to efficiently query data based on non-primary key columns, providing flexibility for specific query use cases.                                      |
| **Monitoring and Management**        | ScyllaDB integrates with monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana, and provides a web-based interface for cluster management and performance monitoring.                                         |
| **Cloud and Kubernetes Support**     | ScyllaDB supports deployment on major cloud platforms and Kubernetes, making it a flexible choice for cloud-native and containerized environments.                                                       |


| Pros                                         | Cons                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Exceptional performance for read/write operations | Requires careful data modeling for optimal performance |
| Seamless horizontal scalability              | Limited support for complex joins compared to relational databases |
| Efficient resource utilization               | Eventual consistency model may not suit all use cases |
| API compatibility with Cassandra ecosystem   | Relatively new, with a smaller community compared to established databases |
| Self-tuning capabilities reduce operational overhead | Requires specialized knowledge for advanced operations |



## Conclusion

ScyllaDB represents a significant advancement in the world of NoSQL databases, offering a powerful solution for organizations dealing with big data and high-performance requirements. Its key strengths include:

1. **Performance**: ScyllaDB's architecture is designed to maximize hardware utilization, resulting in exceptional performance even under heavy loads. Its ability to handle millions of operations per second with consistently low latencies makes it suitable for demanding use cases.

2. **Scalability**: With its shared-nothing architecture and automatic data distribution, ScyllaDB can easily scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. This allows organizations to grow their database capacity in line with their needs.

3. **Compatibility**: Being API-compatible with Apache Cassandra, ScyllaDB offers a smooth transition for teams already familiar with Cassandra, while providing performance improvements and easier operations.

4. **Efficiency**: ScyllaDB's resource-efficient design helps organizations reduce their infrastructure costs while maintaining high performance.

5. **Ease of Use**: Despite its powerful features, ScyllaDB maintains a relatively straightforward setup and operation process, as demonstrated in this documentation.
