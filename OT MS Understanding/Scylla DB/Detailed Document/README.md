## Purpose

 We are preparing this document so that we can get the detailed information of ScyllaDB.


## Architecture

ScyllaDB follows a distributed architecture where data is automatically replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and high availability.

# Features

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distributed NoSQL Database**       | - Handles large volumes of data across multiple nodes.<br>- Provides fault tolerance and scalability through data replication.  |
| **API-Compatible with Apache Cassandra** | - Fully compatible with Apache Cassandra's drivers, tools, and CQL.<br>- Enables easy migration from Cassandra.                |
| **High-Throughput, Low-Latency Operations** | - Uses a shard-per-core model.<br>- Offers high performance for real-time analytics.<br>- Handles millions of operations per second. |
| **Automatic Sharding and Replication** | - Automates data sharding and replication.<br>- Balances load and ensures high availability.<br>- Reduces manual management.     |
| **Tunable Consistency Levels**       | - Configurable for strong or eventual consistency.<br>- Adapts to specific application requirements.                           |
| **Advanced Compaction Strategies**   | - Provides options for optimizing storage and read performance.<br>- Allows selection of strategies based on workload.          |
| **Lightweight Transactions**         | - Supports linearizable consistency.<br>- Ideal for scenarios requiring strict order and consistency, such as financial transactions. |
| **Materialized Views**               | - Automatically updates based on changes to a base table.<br>- Enhances performance for read-heavy workloads.                   |
| **Secondary Indexes**                | - Enables efficient querying based on non-primary key columns.<br>- Provides flexibility for specific query use cases.          |
| **Monitoring and Management**        | - Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana.<br>- Offers a web-based interface for cluster management and performance monitoring. |
| **Cloud and Kubernetes Support**     | - Supports deployment on major cloud platforms and Kubernetes.<br>- Suitable for cloud-native and containerized environments.   |
                                                      |


| Pros                                         | Cons                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Exceptional performance for read/write operations | Requires careful data modeling for optimal performance |
| Seamless horizontal scalability              | Limited support for complex joins compared to relational databases |
| Efficient resource utilization               | Eventual consistency model may not suit all use cases |
| API compatibility with Cassandra ecosystem   | Relatively new, with a smaller community compared to established databases |
| Self-tuning capabilities reduce operational overhead | Requires specialized knowledge for advanced operations |



## Conclusion

ScyllaDB is a powerful NoSQL database that excels in performance and scalability, handling big data and high loads efficiently. It provides a smooth transition from Apache Cassandra with improved performance, reduces infrastructure costs, and maintains a straightforward setup and operation process.
