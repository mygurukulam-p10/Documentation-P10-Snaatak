## Purpose
The purpose of this POC is to demonstrate the functionality and integration of the ReactJS-based frontend application as the main UI for the OT-Microservices stack. This POC will validate the application's cross-platform compatibility, confirm its ability to operate with only JavaScript runtime modules, and verify the seamless execution of web page operations using the ReactJS framework. Additionally, the POC aims to test the integration and reliability of test cases for ensuring proper application functionality.
