## 5. Block Architecture of Redis

The Redis architecture can be divided into three main components: the Client, the Server, and the Storage. Let's examine each in detail:

### 1. Redis Client

- The Redis Client is the interface through which applications interact with Redis.
- Examples of Redis clients include:
  - `jedis`: A popular Java client for Redis
  - `ioredis`: A robust, performance-focused Redis client for Node.js

- Clients send commands to the Redis server and receive responses.
- They handle connection management, command pipelining, and response parsing.

### 2. Redis Server

The Redis Server is the core of the Redis architecture and consists of several components:

#### 2.1 Redis Engine

- The Redis Engine is the central processing unit of Redis.
- It handles:
  - Command execution
  - Data structure management
  - Event loop for non-blocking I/O operations

#### 2.2 Keyspace

- The Keyspace is where Redis stores all its key-value pairs.
- It's an in-memory dictionary that maps keys to their corresponding values.
- The Keyspace is central to Redis's fast read and write operations.

#### 2.3 Commands

- This component represents the set of Redis commands available for data manipulation and management.
- It includes operations for various data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, etc.
- Examples: `GET`, `SET`, `LPUSH`, `HSET`, `ZADD`, etc.

#### 2.4 RAM

- Redis primarily operates in-memory, using RAM for data storage.
- This is key to Redis's high-performance characteristics.
- The image shows binary data (011101010111...) to represent data stored in RAM.

#### 2.5 Device (CPU/GPU/TPU)

- This represents the hardware resources used by Redis.
- While Redis primarily uses CPU, some operations can be optimized for GPU or TPU in specialized setups.

### 3. Storage

- Although Redis is primarily an in-memory database, it offers persistence options:
  - **AOF (Append-Only File):** Logs every write operation received by the server.
  - **RDB (Redis Database):** Creates point-in-time snapshots of the dataset.
- The Storage component represents the disk where these persistence files are stored.

### Data Flow

1. The Redis Client sends commands to the Server.
2. The Redis Engine processes these commands, interacting with the Keyspace and executing the appropriate operations.
3. Data is read from or written to RAM.
4. If persistence is enabled, data changes are written to Storage using AOF or RDB methods.

This architecture allows Redis to provide high-speed data access while also offering options for data durability and persistence.

## 6. Types of Redis Architecture

1. **Standalone:**
   - Single Redis instance.
   - Suitable for small-scale applications.

2. **Sentinel:**
   - Provides high availability.
   - Monitors Redis instances and performs automatic failover.

3. **Cluster:**
   - Horizontal scaling through sharding.
   - Distributes data across multiple nodes.
