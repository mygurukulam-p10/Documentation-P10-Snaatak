## 1. What is a Database and Cache?

### Database
- Persistent storage system for structured data.
- Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Ensures data integrity and consistency.
- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

### Cache
- Temporary storage layer for frequently accessed data.
- Improves application performance by reducing database load.
- Typically stores data in memory for faster access.
- **Examples:** Redis, Memcached.

## 2. Why We Are Learning Redis and the Problems It Addresses

1. **Performance Bottleneck:**
   - Provides in-memory data storage for high-speed data access.
   - Reduces latency in data retrieval operations.

2. **Data Caching:**
   - Efficiently caches frequently accessed data.
   - Reduces load on primary databases.

3. **Session Management:**
   - Stores and manages user session data.
   - Enables quick retrieval of session information.

4. **Real-time Analytics:**
   - Supports real-time data processing and analysis.
   - Provides data structures suitable for analytics use cases.

5. **Scalability Challenges:**
   - Offers clustering and replication for horizontal scaling.
   - Supports high throughput and low latency at scale.

6. **Message Queuing:**
   - Implements Pub/Sub messaging system.
   - Facilitates communication between different parts of an application.

7. **Data Persistence and Reliability:**
   - Offers options for data persistence (RDB and AOF).
   - Supports replication for high availability.

## 3. Alternatives and Comparison

### Redis vs Memcached
