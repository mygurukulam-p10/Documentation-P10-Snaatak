|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACID Compliance**        | Ensures data integrity through atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. |
| **Open Source**            | Free and open-source, with a large community and active development.     |
| **Advanced Data Types**    | Supports a wide range of data types, including JSON, XML, arrays, ranges, and user-defined types. |
| **High Availability**      |  Supports replication and clustering for redundancy and fault tolerance.  |
| **Powerful Querying**      | Provides a rich SQL language for querying and manipulating data.        |
| **Scalability**            | Can handle large datasets and heavy workloads.     |
| **Robust Security**        | Offers strong security features such as user authentication, access control, and encryption.     |

### Key Concepts

| Term               | Description                                                                                  |

|      **Database**    | A collection of related data objects like tables, views, and functions.          |
|     **Schema**       | A logical grouping of database objects within a database.                        |
| **Table**     | A structured collection of data records with rows and columns.         |
| **Column**    | A named attribute of a table that holds specific data types like integers, text, or timestamps.       |
|   **Row**     | A single instance of data in a table, containing values for each column.      |
| **SQL (Structured Query Language)**    | A standardized language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.  |
| **Indexes**    | Data structures that improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.           |
| **Constraints**    | Rules that enforce data integrity by restricting the type or format of data allowed in a table.  |

### Why use PostgreSQL

### Creating and Managing a PostgreSQL Database

| **Rule** | **Description**  |
|----------|------------------|
| **Installation**| Use [Postgreql POC link For installation of PostgreSQL](https://github.com/mygurukulam-p10/Documention/tree/main/OT%20MS%20Understanding/PostgreSQL/Setup%20and%20run%20the%20PostgreSQL%20for%20POC)
 |
| **Database Creation** | Use the CREATE DATABASE command to create a new database instance.|
| **Schema Definition** | Design your database schema by defining tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.|
| **Data Manipulation** | Use SQL commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to insert, modify, and remove data from tables.|
| **User Management**| Create users and assign them appropriate access privileges to secure your database.|
| **Backups and Recovery** |Regularly back up your database to ensure data is recoverable in case of failures.            |

### Common SQL Commands

| **Command** |     **Purpose**      |

| **DELETE FROM** | Deletes data from a table. |
| **SELECT** | Retrieves data from a table. |
| **WHERE** | Filters results based on conditions. |
| **JOIN** | Combines data from multiple tables.|
| **GROUP BY** | Groups data based on specified columns. |
| **HAVING** | Filters grouped data based on conditions. |
| **ORDER BY** | Sorts results based on specified columns. |
