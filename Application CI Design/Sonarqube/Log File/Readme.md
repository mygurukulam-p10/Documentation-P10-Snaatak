## Overview of SonarQube Logs
SonarQube logs provide insights into the operations of various components, including the web server, compute engine, database, and Elasticsearch. Understanding these logs is essential for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Types of Logs

| Log Type                  | Description                                                                 | Log File Location                  | Log Level    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| Web Server Logs           | Logs HTTP requests and responses handled by the SonarQube web server.      | `<SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs/web.log`  | INFO, ERROR  |
| Ce Logs (Compute Engine)  | Logs background tasks related to code analysis and project processing.     | `<SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs/ce.log`    | INFO, ERROR  |
| Es Logs (Elasticsearch)   | Logs related to the Elasticsearch service, including indexing and queries. | `<SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs/es.log`    | DEBUG, INFO  |
| Db Logs (Database)        | Logs SQL queries and database interactions.                                 | `<SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs/db.log`    | DEBUG, INFO  |
| Scanner Logs              | Logs produced during the analysis performed by SonarQube scanners.         | Depends on the scanner used        | Varies       |
| Security Logs             | Logs related to authentication, authorization, and security events.        | `<SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs/security.log` | INFO, ERROR  |

## Log Levels
SonarQube supports several log levels to classify the importance of log messages:

| Log Level | Description                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| TRACE     | Detailed information used for debugging.             |
| DEBUG     | Information useful for developers, including technical details. |
| INFO      | General information about the system's operations.   |
| WARN      | Indicates potential issues or warnings.              |
| ERROR     | Indicates an error that occurred in the application.  |
| FATAL     | Critical errors that may cause the system to crash.  |

## Log Configuration
SonarQube allows you to configure logging settings through the `sonar.properties` file. You can set log levels for different components by modifying the following properties:

```properties
# Example configuration
sonar.log.level.web=INFO
sonar.log.level.ce=DEBUG
sonar.log.level.es=DEBUG
sonar.log.level.db=INFO
