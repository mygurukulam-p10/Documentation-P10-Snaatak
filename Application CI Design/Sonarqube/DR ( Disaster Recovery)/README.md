## 🎯 Purpose
This document provides a detailed plan for ensuring the quick and effective recovery of SonarQube in the event of a system failure or disaster. The goal is to minimize downtime and data loss while ensuring Appliction continuity through clear backup and restoration procedures.

---

## 📖 Overview
The Disaster Recovery (DR) plan focuses on SonarQube's database, configuration files, and optional Elasticsearch data. This plan ensures that in the case of failure, all critical SonarQube data can be restored quickly.

---

## 🔐 Backup Procedures

### 📂 Database Backup
Backup the SonarQube PostgreSQL database to ensure that critical data is preserved.

### 🛠️ Configuration Backup
Backup the SonarQube configuration files, including `sonar.properties` and `wrapper.conf`.

### 🔍 Elasticsearch Data Backup (Optional)
Backup Elasticsearch data, though it can be recreated from the database if necessary.

---

## ♻️ Restoration Procedures

### 💾 Database Restoration
Step-by-step guide to restore the PostgreSQL database.

### 🔧 Configuration Restoration
Restore the SonarQube configuration files to their original state.

### 📊 Elasticsearch Data Restoration (Optional)
Restore Elasticsearch indices from the backup, if applicable.

---

## ⏱️ Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
The expected time required to restore SonarQube in case of a failure. This will include time for database and configuration restoration, along with service validation.

---

## 🚨 Disaster Recovery Testing
Regular testing procedures to ensure that the backup and restoration processes work as expected, reducing the risk of extended downtime.
