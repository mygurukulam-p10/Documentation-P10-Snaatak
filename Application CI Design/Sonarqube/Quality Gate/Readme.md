## Introduction
SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It helps developers manage code quality and security vulnerabilities while maintaining high standards across software projects. Quality gates are a crucial feature within SonarQube that determines whether a project meets the predefined quality criteria before moving to the next phase of development.

## What is SonarQube Quality Gate?
A Quality Gate is a set of conditions that a project must meet before it can be considered satisfactory. These conditions may include metrics related to code coverage, code duplications, maintainability, reliability, security, and more. Quality gates help enforce coding standards and ensure that code changes do not degrade the quality of the existing codebase.

## Why Use Quality Gates?
- **Early Detection**: Identify issues early in the development process to reduce the cost of fixing them later.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage teams to strive for higher quality code with every release.
- **Team Accountability**: Promote accountability among team members regarding code quality.
- **Automated Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback to developers about the quality of their code, allowing for quicker adjustments.

## Types of Quality Gates
SonarQube allows the creation of different types of quality gates, including:
| Type                | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default Quality Gate** | Predefined set of conditions focused on essential metrics. |
| **Custom Quality Gate**  | User-defined gate tailored to project-specific needs.      |
| **Branch Quality Gate**  | Conditions applied to branches (e.g., feature, release).   |

# Implementation of Quality Gates

## Step 1: Set Up a SonarQube Project

1. **Log in to SonarQube**
   - Open the SonarQube dashboard by navigating to the URL where SonarQube is hosted.
   - Log in using your credentials.

2. **Create a New Project**
   - From the main dashboard, go to the **Projects** tab.
   - Click on **Create Local Project**.

3. **Configure Project Key and Display Name**
   - Set the **Project Key** (a unique identifier for the project).
   - Set the **Display Name** (how it will appear on the dashboard).
   - Enter the project name (e.g., `Attendence`).

4. **Generate Authentication Token**
   - After the project is created, SonarQube will prompt you to generate a **token**.
   - Click **Generate**, and copy the token to a secure location for later use.

5. **Configure Your Build Tool**
   - Integrate SonarQube with your build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions).
   - Use the generated token to authenticate the scans from your build tool.

6. **Install SonarQube Scanner**
   - Install the SonarQube scanner locally
   - create a file called sonar-project.properties where we will define sonarqube properties
