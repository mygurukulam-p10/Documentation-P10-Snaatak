## 1. Introduction to SonarQube Authorization
SonarQube is a platform for continuous code quality inspection. To maintain the integrity of your projects and their analysis, SonarQube implements an authorization system that restricts access and actions based on the user’s roles and permissions. This document explains SonarQube’s authorization mechanisms and how they help in securing access to project data.

## 2. Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication** refers to the process of verifying a user's identity, typically through credentials like usernames and passwords.
- **Authorization** determines what actions a user can perform after they are authenticated. In SonarQube, authorization is managed through roles and permissions.

SonarQube offers multiple methods for authentication (LDAP, OAuth, SAML), but this document focuses on **authorization**, the process of granting or restricting access rights to users based on their roles.

## 3. Overview of SonarQube’s Authorization Model
SonarQube’s authorization model is role-based, meaning access is controlled by assigning users to groups with predefined permissions. This allows fine-grained control over who can view, edit, and manage projects, issues, and global settings.

### Key Components of SonarQube Authorization:
- **Users**: Individual accounts who interact with the platform.
- **Groups**: Collections of users with shared permissions. Group membership defines what users can do.
- **Permissions**: Specific actions that a user or group can perform (viewing projects, running analyses, etc.).
- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions that are assigned to groups or individual users. 

## 4. SonarQube Default Groups and Roles

### 4.1 Built-in Groups:
SonarQube provides some built-in groups with predefined roles:
- **Anyone**: Contains all users, including anonymous users.
- **sonar-users**: All authenticated users belong to this group by default.
- **sonar-administrators**: Users with administrative privileges.

### 4.2 Built-in Roles:
- **Administer System**: Full access to manage all system configurations, including plugin management and system upgrades.
- **Create Projects**: Users can create new projects.
- **Administer Quality Profiles**: Users can manage quality profiles.
- **Execute Analysis**: Users can run project analyses manually.

### 4.3 Custom Groups and Roles:
Admins can create custom groups and assign specific permissions tailored to an organization's needs. This helps enforce security policies by limiting access to sensitive projects or features.

## 5. Project-Level Permissions

SonarQube enables fine-grained control over who can interact with specific projects through **project-level permissions**. You can assign permissions to individual users or groups at the project level, restricting access to sensitive data.

### Key Project-Level Permissions:
- **Browse**: Allows viewing project information and analysis results.
- **Administer**: Grants full control over the project, including changing settings and quality profiles.
- **Execute Analysis**: Allows the execution of code analysis on the project.
- **Provision Projects**: Permission to create new projects under a specified scope.

## 6. Global Permissions
In addition to project-specific permissions, SonarQube offers **global permissions** that provide overarching control over all projects and system settings. These are ideal for administrators who manage multiple projects and need a centralized view of security.

### Important Global Permissions:
- **Administer**: Allows full access to SonarQube, including the configuration of global settings.
- **Execute Analysis**: Lets users run analysis for all projects.
- **Provision Projects**: Enables users to create new projects.

## 7. Managing Permissions in SonarQube
### 7.1 Assigning Permissions
- Permissions can be assigned via the **Administration > Security > Global Permissions** or **Project Permissions** sections in SonarQube.
- Administrators can assign permissions to **groups** (preferred) or **individual users**.

### 7.2 Permission Inheritance
Global permissions can be inherited at the project level, but administrators can override them as needed. For instance, you may grant browse rights to all users globally but restrict administrative rights to specific projects.

### 7.3 User Authentication and Group Mapping
If using external authentication systems (like LDAP or SAML), users can be automatically mapped to groups based on their roles in the external directory. This reduces manual intervention in managing group memberships.

## 8. Best Practices

### 8.1 Principle of Least Privilege
Always follow the **principle of least privilege**: Users should only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized changes or data breaches.

### 8.2 Use Groups Instead of Individual Permissions
It’s easier to manage security by assigning permissions to **groups** rather than individuals. Group-based permissions ensure consistency and reduce errors when scaling the number of users.

### 8.3 Regular Audits
Regularly audit **user roles** and **permissions** to ensure that access rights are up to date. Removing access for users who no longer need it is crucial for maintaining security.

### 8.4 Use External Authentication and Group Synchronization
If possible, integrate SonarQube with external authentication providers like LDAP, SAML, or OAuth. This simplifies user management and ensures that roles and permissions are in sync with your organization’s directory.

### 8.5 Custom Role Definitions
For organizations with complex workflows, creating **custom roles** allows fine-tuning of access control. Custom roles can enforce unique access models, ensuring users have precisely the permissions they need.

## 9. Auditing and Tracking Authorization
SonarQube keeps a log of authorization changes (who assigned permissions, when they were changed, etc.). Admins should regularly review these logs to ensure compliance with internal security policies.

### 9.1 Security Events Logging
Use SonarQube’s **logging** feature to track any changes in user access rights or permissions. These logs can be useful for identifying unauthorized access attempts or tracking permission changes.

### 9.2 Integration with Monitoring Tools
Integrate SonarQube with external security tools for real-time monitoring of security events. This ensures any unauthorized access or misuse of permissions is caught early.

## 10. Conclusion
SonarQube provides a robust authorization model that offers granular control over who can access, modify, and manage resources in your code quality inspection platform. By implementing proper role-based access control, regularly auditing permissions, and enforcing the principle of least privilege, organizations can effectively secure their code and analysis results.
