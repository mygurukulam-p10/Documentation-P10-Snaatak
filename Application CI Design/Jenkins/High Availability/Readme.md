# 🔍 Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of key features and functionalities of Jenkins. It aims to explain important aspects such as its extensibility, server-based security features, and ease of distribution. By detailing these features, the document seeks to help users understand how Jenkins can be effectively utilized and customized to meet their Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) needs. Additionally, it offers insights into the tools and capabilities Jenkins provides to enhance build automation, manage security, and streamline development workflows.

# 🌟 What is High Availibility?
High availability means that an IT system, component, or application can operate at a high level, continuously, without intervention, for a given time period. High-availability infrastructure is configured to deliver quality performance and handle different loads and failures with minimal or zero downtime.

# 💥How to configure Jenkins with High Availability?
Jenkins is the crucial component of DevOps and you may be set up Jenkins in production, but when it comes to the production end, things become more important but if something goes down or an event occurs, such as an increase in load. As a result, it could impact production and cause it to halt. So, you can configure Jenkins’ instantaneous live backup.
Here, will see how to set up Jenkins, how to create pipelines, nodes and make Jenkins available.

### There is two thing:

**Jenkins master-slave setup,**
**Jenkins HA(High Availability)**

## 1. What is Master-slave configuration?
The term “master-slave” describes the high availability of a Jenkins node, such as the master node, which is a single built-in node that can distribute the burden of testing, building, and deploying an application across several slave or agent servers. The Jenkins slave nodes are assigned tasks by the master node, which manages job scheduling, while the slave nodes, also known as agent nodes, are responsible for building, testing, and deploying the application. Jenkins machines’ scalability, availability, and resource efficiency were all improved by the master-salve setup.

There is a difference between master-slave setup and HA. So, let’s have a look on that:

So, in this blog there is two thing:

Jenkins master-slave setup,
Jenkins HA(High Availability)

## There are two ways you can have Jenkins in HA mode.

### 1. Jenkins active/passive setup:
Only enterprise Jenkins comes with a supported plugin to have this setup. But most organizations use open-source versions, and this option is out of scope. Also there is an option with HAproxy, however I think its bit of an administrative overhead.



**Jenkins HA setup in autoscaling Group:** Having Jenkins in autoscaling group is workaround to have a higly available Jenkins. It is not a 100% HA solution; however, for any reason if your Jenkins server crasher, another instance will come up within a short period.




## Let's discuss all the features in detail:

## 1. A variety of plugins
Jenkins plugins are extensions that enhance Jenkins' capabilities by integrating CI/CD tools, sources, and destinations, and expanding its functionality. With around 1,500 plugins available, they allow for extensive customization, enabling Jenkins to integrate with other software, add UI components, and improve build and source code management. Plugins can be installed via the Jenkins Web UI or CLI from the Jenkins Plugin repository.
