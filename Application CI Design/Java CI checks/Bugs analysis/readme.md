### Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential part of modern software development. It ensures that code changes are automatically tested and validated before they are integrated into the main branch, Running automated CI checks helps identify issues such as bugs, code quality violations, and performance bottlenecks early in the development lifecycle. One of the critical aspects of Java CI checks is Bugs Analysis, which involves identifying, analyzing, and resolving bugs in the code to ensure software quality and reliability.

### What is Bugs Analysis in Java CI?
Bugs analysis in CI is the process of automatically detecting code defects (bugs) during the CI pipeline. Bugs can range from logic errors to runtime exceptions, and CI tools aim to catch these bugs as early as possible. For Java applications, this is often achieved by running static analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage tools as part of the CI pipeline.

### Why is Bugs Analysis Important?
| **Advantage**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early Bug Detection         | Identifying and fixing bugs early reduces the cost and effort required for later stages. |
| Code Quality                | Ensuring that the code adheres to coding standards and best practices.           |
| Continuous Feedback         | Providing developers with immediate feedback on their code changes.             |
| Reduced Integration Problems| Minimizing conflicts and integration issues by frequently merging changes.       |

### Different Tools for Bugs Analysis
