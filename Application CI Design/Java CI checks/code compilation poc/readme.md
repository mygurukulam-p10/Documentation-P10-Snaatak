## Introduction 
* This document will guide you through a Proof of Concept (PoC) for setting up and compiling a Maven project. We will cover the necessary prerequisites, including Java and Maven installation, as well as the basic project structure.


##  Pre-requisites

- Java
- Maven

## System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Processor                | dual-core              |
| RAM                      | 2 GB                    |
| Disk                     |5 GB free disk space                  |
| OS                       | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS         |


##  Build-Time Dependency

| üõ†Ô∏è Name | üì¶ Version | üìÑ Description |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Maven** | 3.+      | Simplifies build management, project documentation, and dependency management. |

---

##  Run-Time Dependency

| üöÄ Name | üì¶ Version | üìÑ Description          |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Java** |  17 for Spring Boot 3.1.1        | Required to run the built Java application. |

##  Step-by-step Installation

## Install git
```
sudo apt install git
```
### üìÇ Step 1: Clone the Git Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/salary-api.git
```

### Step 2: Change Directory
Change Directory to where your code is
```
cd salary-api
```

### Step 3: now we have to do Code Compilation
This command compiles the source code of the project according to the settings defined in the pom.xml file.
```
mvn compile
```
![compile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a41dd76-d90a-40bf-a91a-c0bbe726cb70)
- When you see a ‚ÄúBUILD SUCCESS‚Äù message after running the mvn compile command in Maven, it means that the source code of your project has been successfully compiled without any errors and your project‚Äôs source code is now ready for the next phases, such as testing or packaging.


## Conclusion
The mvn compile command is a fundamental part of the Maven build lifecycle, responsible for compiling the source code of a Java project. By following a structured process, Maven ensures that all dependencies are resolved, and the code is compiled efficiently. This makes Maven an essential tool for managing and building Java projects, especially in enterprise environments where standardization and integration with CI/CD practices are crucial.
