# Java CI Checks | DAST Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This documentation outlines the implementation and best practices of integrating Java CI checks and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in a CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to ensure code quality, security compliance, and continuous security scanning as part of the development lifecycle.

## 2. What are Java CI Checks?

Java CI (Continuous Integration) checks are automated processes that validate the quality, security, and compliance of Java code before it is merged into the main codebase. These checks help in identifying potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and deviations from coding standards.

### 2.1 Key Components
- **Static Code Analysis**: Detects potential coding errors, vulnerabilities, and code smells using tools like Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs.
- **Unit Testing**: Validates code correctness through testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
- **Code Coverage**: Measures the extent to which the source code is tested.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Checks for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.

## 3. What is DAST?

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing method that analyzes a running application to find vulnerabilities. It does so by simulating real-world attacks on the application to discover potential security flaws.

### 3.1 Key Features of DAST
- **Black-box Testing**: Tests the application without access to the source code, emulating an external attacker.
- **Automated Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes the application's behavior and response to various inputs.
- **Compliance Coverage**: Ensures that the application meets security standards like OWASP Top 10 and PCI DSS.

## 4. Why Use DAST?

DAST helps identify security vulnerabilities that are often missed by static analysis. It is crucial for ensuring the security of applications in real-time, especially during deployment.

### 4.1 Benefits of DAST
- **Real-time Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities in the live environment that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that the application is not only functionally correct but also secure.
- **Scalability**: Can be applied to multiple environments without requiring access to the source code.
- **Compliance**: Helps in achieving compliance with security standards and regulations.

## 5. Different DAST Tools

There are several tools available to perform dynamic testing on web applications. Each tool offers different features, integrations, and ease of use.

### 5.1 Popular DAST Tools
- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: Open-source tool used for automated security testing of web applications.
- **Burp Suite**: Comprehensive suite for web application security testing.
- **Acunetix**: Automated web vulnerability scanner with extensive DAST features.
- **AppScan**: Enterprise-grade security testing tool for web and mobile applications.
- **Netsparker**: Automated security testing tool focused on accuracy and ease of use.

## 6. Comparison of DAST Tools

| **Tool**        | **License**    | **Key Features**                    | **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                      |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OWASP ZAP       | Open-source    | Automated scans, API support       | Free, community-driven, integrates with CI/CD | Slower than commercial tools                |
| Burp Suite      | Commercial     | Manual and automated testing       | Powerful intercepting proxy, wide range of plugins | Expensive for enterprise usage              |
| Acunetix        | Commercial     | High-speed scanning, CI/CD integration | Easy to use, broad vulnerability detection | High licensing cost                         |
| AppScan         | Commercial     | Automated testing, compliance reporting | Enterprise-ready, supports multiple languages | Complex setup and configuration             |
| Netsparker      | Commercial     | Proof-based scanning, cloud support  | Accurate detection, automated verification | Limited support for some tech stacks        |

## 7. Advantages of Using DAST

1. **Early Detection of Security Issues**: DAST can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling early detection of security vulnerabilities before they reach production.
2. **Automated Testing**: Saves time and effort with automated scans, reducing manual intervention.
3. **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: Tests all possible endpoints, including REST APIs and microservices.
4. **Integration with Development Workflows**: Can be seamlessly integrated with development workflows, making security testing a continuous process.

## 9. Best Practices for Java CI Checks and DAST

- **Automate Security Scans**: Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic scans with every build.
- **Use Multiple Security Tools**: Combine DAST with Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to get comprehensive security coverage.
- **Run Tests in Different Environments**: Perform security testing in staging and production environments to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Implement Security Gates**: Use security gates in the CI/CD pipeline to stop builds with critical vulnerabilities.
- **Regularly Update Security Tools**: Keep DAST tools up-to-date with the latest security vulnerabilities and testing techniques.
