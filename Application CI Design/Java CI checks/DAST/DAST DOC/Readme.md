## 1. Introduction

This documentation outlines the implementation and best practices of integrating Java CI checks and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in a CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to ensure code quality, security compliance, and continuous security scanning as part of the development lifecycle.

## 2. What is DAST?

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing method that analyzes a running application to find vulnerabilities. It does so by simulating real-world attacks on the application to discover potential security flaws.

### 3.1 Key Features of DAST
- **Black-box Testing**: Tests the application without access to the source code, emulating an external attacker.
- **Automated Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes the application's behavior and response to various inputs.
- **Compliance Coverage**: Ensures that the application meets security standards like OWASP Top 10 and PCI DSS.

## 3. Why Use DAST?

DAST helps identify security vulnerabilities that are often missed by static analysis. It is crucial for ensuring the security of applications in real-time, especially during deployment.

### 3.1 Benefits of DAST
- **Real-time Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities in the live environment that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that the application is not only functionally correct but also secure.
- **Scalability**: Can be applied to multiple environments without requiring access to the source code.
- **Compliance**: Helps in achieving compliance with security standards and regulations.

## 4. Different DAST Tools

There are several tools available to perform dynamic testing on web applications. Each tool offers different features, integrations, and ease of use.

### 4.1 Popular DAST Tools
- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: Open-source tool used for automated security testing of web applications.
- **Burp Suite**: Comprehensive suite for web application security testing.
- **Acunetix**: Automated web vulnerability scanner with extensive DAST features.
- **AppScan**: Enterprise-grade security testing tool for web and mobile applications.
- **Netsparker**: Automated security testing tool focused on accuracy and ease of use.

## 5. Comparison of DAST Tools

| **Tool**        | **License**    | **Key Features**                    | **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                      |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OWASP ZAP       | Open-source    | Automated scans, API support       | Free, community-driven, integrates with CI/CD | Slower than commercial tools                |
| Burp Suite      | Commercial     | Manual and automated testing       | Powerful intercepting proxy, wide range of plugins | Expensive for enterprise usage              |
| Acunetix        | Commercial     | High-speed scanning, CI/CD integration | Easy to use, broad vulnerability detection | High licensing cost                         |
| AppScan         | Commercial     | Automated testing, compliance reporting | Enterprise-ready, supports multiple languages | Complex setup and configuration             |
| Netsparker      | Commercial     | Proof-based scanning, cloud support  | Accurate detection, automated verification | Limited support for some tech stacks        |

## 6. Advantages of Using DAST

1. **Early Detection of Security Issues**: DAST can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling early detection of security vulnerabilities before they reach production.
2. **Automated Testing**: Saves time and effort with automated scans, reducing manual intervention.
3. **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: Tests all possible endpoints, including REST APIs and microservices.
4. **Integration with Development Workflows**: Can be seamlessly integrated with development workflows, making security testing a continuous process.

## 8. Best Practices for DAST

- **Automate Security Scans**: Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic scans with every build.
- **Use Multiple Security Tools**: Combine DAST with Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to get comprehensive security coverage.
- **Run Tests in Different Environments**: Perform security testing in staging and production environments to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Implement Security Gates**: Use security gates in the CI/CD pipeline to stop builds with critical vulnerabilities.
- **Regularly Update Security Tools**: Keep DAST tools up-to-date with the latest security vulnerabilities and testing techniques.
