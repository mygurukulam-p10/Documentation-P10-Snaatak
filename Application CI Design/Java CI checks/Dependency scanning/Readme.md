## Introduction

* Dependency scanning is a process used in software development to identify and analyze the external dependencies or third-party components that a project relies on. These dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, modules, packages, or other code modules that are utilized to build and run the software. 

*** 
## Key Points

* **Automated Security Checks** - Dependency check facilitates the automated detection of vulnerabilities within project dependencies, seamlessly integrating this crucial security check into CI/CD pipelines.
  
* **Efficiency and Accuracy** - It reduces the need for manual effort, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional manual checks.
  
* **Awareness and Reporting** - Developers gain awareness of potential vulnerabilities through reports at an early stage, providing insights into the identified issues and their respective severity levels.

|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Regular Scanning Frequency**                  | Regular scanning of project dependencies is essential for maintaining a secure development environment. Conduct dependency scans at key points in the development lifecycle, such as during the build process, before major releases, and after significant changes.                  |
| **Integration with Other Security Tools**      | Enhance the effectiveness of your security strategy by integrating OWASP Dependency-Check with other security tools. This synergistic approach provides a more comprehensive security analysis (e.g., DAST, Container Security).                                                            |
| **Handling False Positives**                    | False positives in dependency scanning results can occasionally occur. Leverage Dependency-Check's suppression mechanism to manage false positives, ensuring accurate reporting. Engage with the Dependency-Check community to share and verify findings, improving the accuracy of future scans. |
