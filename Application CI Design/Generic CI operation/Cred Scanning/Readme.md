# Generic CI Operation: Credential Scanning


### Introduction
Credential scanning (cred scanning) is a vital aspect of secure Continuous Integration (CI) operations. As part of the CI pipeline, automation tools build, test, and deploy code, making security practices such as credential scanning an essential part of the DevSecOps process. Credential scanning is the process of scanning code, logs, and configurations to ensure no sensitive information, like API keys, passwords, or tokens, is hardcoded or exposed.

In today’s rapid development cycles, it’s easy for developers to mistakenly commit sensitive data to repositories, potentially exposing their applications to attacks. With credential scanning integrated into CI pipelines, organizations can automate the detection and remediation of exposed secrets, ensuring their codebase remains secure.
