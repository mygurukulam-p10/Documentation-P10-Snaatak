## Purpose ðŸŽ¯
This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of dependency scanning in Python project like we have or ```Attendance-API``` , emphasizing its importance in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.


## Pre-requisites

### System Requirements

| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Recommendation |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Processor               | single-core              |
| RAM                     | 1GB                    |
| Disk                    | 10GB                   |
| OS                      | Ubuntu 22.04           |

### Dependencies

| Name     | Version | Description                              |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| Python   | 3.10    | Programming language for the application |
| pip      | 22.0.2  | To manage python packages and it's dependencies|


### Note :- I am using safety as a Dependency Scanning tool in my POC.

## Step-by-step installation

Safety is a command-line tool that checks your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. To demonstrate the capabilities of ```Safety```, hereâ€™s a simple setup guide. We will be using our Microservice ```Attendance-API```

1. **Clone the Repository**

```
https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/attendance-api.git
```
### In this Repository you will see these files in which we will perform the dependency scanning.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd51547e-3445-44e4-81da-e09368ec99a1)

---

2. **Install Safety**:

```bash
pip install safety
```
---

3. **Go to Attendance-API**

```
cd attendance-api/
```

---

4. **Run a Scan**

a.  First Scan on ```pyproject.toml```

```
safety check -r pyproject.toml 
```

 ![safety 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc275cf2-b465-436c-8937-4e352c11ff64)
 
b. Second Scan on ```poetry.lock```

```
 safety check -r poetry.lock
```
   ![Safety 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d48844-08c2-40c6-9ace-de72a1ea1648)
   ![safety 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8c1326e-fbac-4160-a2a8-be540196c119)
   ![safety 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5ba782-7aa2-4325-ad20-1e20d0584b4c)
