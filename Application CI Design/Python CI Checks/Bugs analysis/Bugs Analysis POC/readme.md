## 📖 Introduction
Bandit is a tool that scans Python code to find common security issues. It processes each file, builds an abstract syntax tree (AST), and runs plugins against the AST nodes to detect vulnerabilities. After scanning, Bandit generates a report highlighting any issues found.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🐍 **Language Compatibility**: Supports Python 2.x and 3.x.
- 🔍 **Static Analysis**: Analyzes code without execution to find vulnerabilities.
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**: Extendable with custom checks.
- 🛠️ **Common Vulnerabilities**: Detects issues like hardcoded secrets and unsafe `eval()` use.
- 🔒 **Security Checks**: Identifies potential SQL injection, XSS, and command injection flaws.
- 🔗 **Integration**: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated checks.
- 📊 **Extensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with severity levels and issue locations.
- ⚙️ **Configurability**: Offers customizable options to adjust analysis settings.
- 💻 **Command Line Interface**: Simple CLI for easy use.
- 🚀 **Active Development**: Maintained by the OpenStack Security Project.
- 🆓 **Open Source**: Available under Apache 2.0 license.

## 📋 Pre-requisites
- 🐍 **Python 3**: Bandit requires Python 3 to run.

## ⚙️ Installing Bandit
Install Bandit using pip:

```bash
pip install bandit
```
🧑‍💻 Using Bandit
To scan all Python files in a directory, use:

``

bandit -r .
```
For a specific file:
```
bandit -r /path/to/your/code.py
```
Include low-severity issues:

```
bandit -r . -ll
```
Set a severity threshold:

``
bandit -r /path/to/your/code -s MEDIUM
```
Exclude files or directories:

```
bandit -r . -x some_directory/
```
🚀 Proof of Concept (POC)
Example command:

bash
Copy code
bandit -r /home/ubuntu/employee_api
