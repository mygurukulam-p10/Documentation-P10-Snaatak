## 📥 Step-by-step Installation

## Install git
```
sudo apt install git
```
###  Step 1: Clone the Git Repository
```
https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/attendance-api.git
```
### Step 2: Change Directory
Change Directory to where your code is
```
cd attendance-api
```

## First Install

# Step 3: For Unit Tresting

## First Install
running pip install pytest installs the pytest library, enabling you to write and run tests for your Python code effectively.
```
pip install pytest
```

![ue1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f21f68c-1d57-4680-9824-f11cdf73dc77)
- enabling your Python applications to communicate with PostgreSQL databases.
```
pip install psycopg2
```
![ue2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc9c6dd-63ab-466a-8b67-de76d6bea345)

- Using these imports, you can easily connect to a PostgreSQL database and utilize advanced features provided by psycopg2.
```
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import extras
```

![ue1cp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d686ca4-4223-476d-bbe9-b7b691dc2cc5)
-  running pip install pytest-mock installs the pytest-mock library, allowing you to effectively use mocking techniques in your pytest tests to isolate and test specific functionalities without relying on external dependencies.
```
pip install pytest-mock
```
![ue1rou](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6427ef04-2464-4aee-a3b6-0d62e463b28e)

router
- running pip install Flask installs the Flask framework, allowing you to develop web applications in Python efficiently.
```
pip install Flask
```
- running pip install Flask-Caching installs the Flask-Caching extension, enabling you to implement caching in your Flask applications to enhance performance and reduce server load.
```
pip install Flask-Caching
```

utils/tests/test_json_encoder.py
- running pip install peewee installs the Peewee library, enabling you to use an ORM(stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a database using object-oriented programming languages.) for database interactions in your Python applications.
```
pip install peewee
```

utils/tests/test_log_encoder.py
running pip install python-json-logger installs the python-json-logger library, enabling you to format log messages as JSON, which is useful for structured logging in applications.
```
pip install python-json-logger
```

utils/tests/test_validator.py
- running pip install voluptuous installs the Voluptuous library, enabling you to validate Python data structures against defined schemas efficiently.
```
pip install voluptuous
```

## To check how many test cases have passed (or failed) when using pytest
this command is a common way to run unit tests in Python projects, leveraging the capabilities of the pytest framework.
```
python3 -m pytest
```
