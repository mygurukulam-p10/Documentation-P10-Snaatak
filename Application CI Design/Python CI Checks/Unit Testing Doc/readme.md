# Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that encourages developers to integrate their code into a shared repository frequently. Unit testing is a critical part of the software development process, ensuring that individual components of your application function as expected. This project showcases how to use unit tests in Python.

# What are Unit Testing?
Unit testing involves testing individual components (or units) of code to verify that they perform as expected. In Python, this often involves testing functions, methods, or classes to ensure they return the correct results given a set of inputs.

# Why Unit Testing?

| **Benefit**                  | **Description**                                                                  |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Early Bug Detection**      | Catch issues before they reach production.                                      |
| **Documentation**            | Unit tests serve as a form of documentation for how the code is supposed to behave. |
|**Regression Testing**| They help in regression testing by verifying that previously fixed bugs donâ€™t reappear.|
| **Modularity**          | To make code testable, developers often break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. |


# Different Tools for Unit Testing in Python
- **Unittest**
- **Pytest**
 - **Doctest**
- **Coverage.py**

# Advantages

| **Feature**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Testing**      | Tests run automatically on every code push, catching issues early.            |
| **Quality Assurance**      | Consistent testing leads to a higher quality codebase.                        |
| **Faster Feedback Loop**   | Developers receive immediate feedback on their changes, allowing for quicker iterations. |

# Disadvantages
| **Aspect**                  | **Description**                                                                                      |
