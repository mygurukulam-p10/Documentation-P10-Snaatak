## 📖Introduction
Dynamic application security testing (DAST) represents a non-functional testing process to identify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an application. This testing process can be carried out either manually or by using automated tools.

## ❓What is DAST?
DAST involves testing a running application for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks from an external perspective. Unlike static analysis, DAST examines the application in its deployed state, identifying issues such as SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Why Use DAST in Python?
- Early identification of vulnerabilities.
- Compliance with security standards.
- Real-time feedback for developers to enhance code security before deployment.

## 🔧Different Tools for DAST
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Acunetix**
- **Netsparker**


## 🔬Comparison of DAST Tools
| **Tool**        | **License**    | **Key Features**                    | **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                      |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OWASP ZAP       | Open-source    | Automated scans, API support       | Free, community-driven, integrates with CI/CD | Slower than commercial tools                |
| Burp Suite      | Commercial     | Manual and automated testing       | Powerful intercepting proxy, wide range of plugins | Expensive for enterprise usage              |
| Acunetix        | Commercial     | High-speed scanning, CI/CD integration | Easy to use, broad vulnerability detection | High licensing cost                         |
| Netsparker      | Commercial     | Proof-based scanning, cloud support  | Accurate detection, automated verification | Limited support for some tech stacks        |

## 🌟Advantages of DAST
| **Aspect**                          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identifies Vulnerabilities**      | DAST can pinpoint security vulnerabilities in a live environment, mimicking real-world attacks. |
| **No Source Code Needed**           | It doesn't require access to the application's source code, making it versatile. |
| **Enhances Compliance**             | Helps in meeting regulatory compliance by identifying security issues early. |
| **Language Independent**            | Works with applications written in any programming language. |
| **Comprehensive Testing**           | Evaluates the entire application, including server configurations and authentication. |


## 🌟Disadvantages of DAST

| **Limitation** | **Description** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cannot detect vulnerabilities in the source code** | Dynamic analysis tests the running application, not the source code. |
| **May produce false positives or negatives** | This can happen due to the complexity of runtime environments. |
| **Limited coverage compared to static analysis** | Dynamic analysis might miss some vulnerabilities that static analysis can catch. |
| **Resource-intensive and time-consuming** | Running tests on a live system can be demanding. |




## Proof of Concept (POC)

## 📏Best Practices
| **Best Practice**                                | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integrate Early in the SDLC**                   | Incorporate DAST tools early in the Software Development Lifecycle to identify issues sooner.    |
| **Automate Scans**                                | Schedule regular DAST scans and automate them in CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous security.  |
| **Prioritize Vulnerabilities**                    | Focus on fixing critical vulnerabilities first, based on the risk and potential impact.          |
| **Educate Developers**                            | Train developers on security best practices and review DAST results to improve code quality.     |
