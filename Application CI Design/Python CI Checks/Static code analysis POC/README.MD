# POC of Static Code Compilation in Python

**Step-1** Clone the Repository:
- Open a terminal (or command prompt).
- Navigate to the desired directory using cd commands.
- Clone the repository using 

```git clone  https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/attendance-api.git

```



**Step-2** Install python and pylint
``` shell 
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install pylint
``` 

++++++++

**Step-3** Run pylint
``` shell 
pylint app.py
```      
+++++++++

# Output
The output we received from running pylint on app.py file indicates the quality of our Python code according to pylint's metrics.
our code has been rated at 10.00/10: This means that pylint has evaluated Python code and assigned it a score of 10 out of 10. This is the highest possible score, indicating that pylint didn't find any issues or violations of Python coding standards in your code.

# Conclusion

The output from pylint indicates that your Python code has been analyzed and evaluated against a set of coding standards and best practices. The conclusions you can draw from the pylint output are:
* High Quality Code
* Code Health

In summary, the pylint output indicates that your Python code is of excellent quality.  This should give you confidence in the reliability and maintainability of your codebase.
