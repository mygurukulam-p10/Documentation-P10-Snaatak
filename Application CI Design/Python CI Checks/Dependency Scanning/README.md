## 📖 Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial practice in modern software development, ensuring code quality and security throughout the development lifecycle. One critical aspect of CI for Python projects is dependency scanning, which helps identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in third-party packages used in your project.

## 🔍 What is Dependency Scanning?
Dependency scanning is the process of automatically analyzing a project's dependencies to identify known security vulnerabilities, outdated packages, and potential licensing issues. For Python projects, this typically involves examining the `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `poetry.lock` files to check the versions of installed packages against databases of known vulnerabilities.

## ❓ Why Perform Dependency Scanning?

| **Reason**                     | **Description**                                                                                      |

Note :- I am using ```safety``` as a Dependency Scanning tool in my POC.

## 💡 Proof of Concept: Using Safety for Dependency Scanning

Safety is a command-line tool that checks your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. Here's how I am integrate it into my microservice of **ATTENDANCE-API**:

1. **Install Safety**:
   ```bash
   pip install safety
   ```

2. **Run a scan**:
   ```bash
   safety check -r requirements.txt
   ```

This configuration will run a safety check on every push and pull request, scanning the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` file for known vulnerabilities as in our ```ATTENDANCE-API``` , We are having these 2 files.

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Dependency Scanning

| **Best Practice**                     | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Run Scans Regularly**              | Make dependency scanning a daily CI task.                                                           |
| **Update Dependencies Frequently**    | Keep packages current.                                                                                |
| **Pin Versions**                      | Specify exact package versions for consistency.                                                      |
| **Use Virtual Environments**          | Avoid dependency conflicts.                                                                          |
| **Monitor Vulnerability Alerts**      | Stay informed of new risks.                                                                          |

## 💼 Recommendation/Conclusion
Implementing dependency scanning in your Python CI pipeline is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of your project. While there are several tools available, each with its strengths, the choice depends on your specific needs:

- For open-source projects or those with basic needs, Safety or pip-audit provide good, free options with easy CI integration.
- For enterprise-level projects requiring comprehensive analysis across multiple languages, Snyk offers advanced features and detailed remediation advice.
- For GitHub-based projects, Dependabot provides native integration and automated pull requests for updates.
- For teams looking for a Python-specific, managed solution, PyUp offers detailed analysis and update recommendations.

Regardless of the tool chosen, regular dependency scanning should be an integral part of your development process. It's recommended to start with a basic tool like Safety and evolve your strategy as your project's needs grow, potentially incorporating multiple tools for comprehensive coverage.
