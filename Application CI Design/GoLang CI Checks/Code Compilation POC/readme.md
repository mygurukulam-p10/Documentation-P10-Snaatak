## Introduction 
* This document will guide you through a Proof of Concept (PoC) for setting up and compiling . We will cover the necessary prerequisites, dependency, Architecture as well as the basic project structure.

## ⚙ Pre-Requisites

- Go installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Go modules.

## 🖥 System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Processor                | dual-core              |
| RAM                      | 4 GB                    |
| Disk                     |10 GB free disk space                  |
| OS                       | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS         |


## 🛠 Build-Time Dependency

| 🛠️ Name | 📦 Version | 📄 Description |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Go modules** | 1.20      | Make sure your Go project uses Go modules (go.mod and go.sum) for dependency management. |


## 🚀 Run-Time Dependency

| 🚀 Name | 📦 Version | 📄 Description          |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **ScyllaDB** |  6.1.1  | ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database being utilized as the primary database in the employee application |

## 🌐 Important Ports

| 🔌 Inbound Traffic | 📄 Description           |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **9042**           | Used by ScyllaDB |


## 🏗 Architecture

- Go Source: This represents the source code written in the Go programming language. It’s the initial code that you write and save in .go files.
  
- Compiler: The compiler is a tool that translates the Go source code into machine code. Within the compiler, there’s a step labeled “asm” which stands for assembly. This step converts the high-level Go code into assembly language, a low-level representation of the code that is closer to machine language.
  
- Executable Binary: The final output of the compilation process is the executable binary. This is the machine code that the computer can directly execute. 
## 📥 Step-by-step Installation

## Install git
```
sudo apt install git
```
### 📂 Step 1: Clone the Git Repository
```
https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/employee-api.git
```

### Step 2: Change Directory
Change Directory to where your code is
```
cd employee-api
```

### Step 3: Code Compilation
This command compiles the source code of the project according to the settings defined in the pom.xml file.
- **go build:** This command compiles the Go source code in the current directory and produces an executable binary.
If successful, it will create a binary file named employee-api.
```
go build
```
- **./employee-api:** This command executes the binary that was created by the go build command.
The ./ indicates that the binary is located in the current directory.
Running this command starts the employee API service, making it ready to handle requests.

```
./employee-api
```

- Compilation Successful: The Go source code has been successfully compiled into an executable binary named employee-api. The service is now ready to be executed and handle incoming requests.
