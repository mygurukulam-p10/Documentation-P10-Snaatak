## Introduction

This document provides a structured guide to implementing bug analysis in Go projects. Bug analysis is an essential practice for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving defects or inefficiencies in code, helping to ensure that your software remains robust, secure, and maintainable. It plays a critical role in preserving code quality and reducing technical debt. By incorporating bug analysis into CI pipelines, teams can continuously monitor and address issues, leading to more stable releases and a smoother development process.

## Why Bug Analysis
