## Introduction
Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. This document provides an overview of code compilation in Go, highlighting tools, benefits, and best practices.

## What is Code Compilation?
Code compilation is the process of converting source code written in a programming language into executable machine code. In Go, this process involves the Go compiler (`go build`), which generates binaries that can be executed on various platforms.

## Why Compile Go Code?
- **Performance:** Compiled binaries run faster than interpreted code.
- **Deployment:** Compiled code is easier to distribute and deploy.
- **Static Typing:** Helps catch errors at compile time, enhancing reliability.

## Different Tools for Go Compilation
- **Go Compiler**
- **Go Modules:**
- **xgo**
- **Third-Party Tools**
- **Makefile**.

## Comparison of Compilation Tools
| Tool                | Description                                 | Ease of Use | 
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Go Compiler (`go build`) | Official compiler for Go projects        | High        | 
| Go Modules          | Dependency management and versioning       | High        | 
| xgo                 | Cross-compilation tool for Go              | Medium      | 
|GCCGO	|Alternative Go compiler using GCC	|Medium	|
|TinyGo	Go compiler for small devices and WebAssembly|	Medium|
|Makefile|	Automates the build process using a Makefile|	Medium|

## Advantages of Go Code Compilation
- **Speed:** Compiled code generally executes faster than interpreted languages.
- **Safety:** Errors are caught during compilation, reducing runtime failures.
- **Simplicity:** The Go toolchain is straightforward, making it easy to compile projects.

| Disk                     |10 GB free disk space                  |
| OS                       | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS         |


## 🛠️ Build-Time Dependency

| 🛠️ Name | 📦 Version | 📄 Description |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Go modules** | 1.20      | Make sure your Go project uses Go modules (go.mod and go.sum) for dependency management. |


## 🚀 Run-Time Dependency

| 🚀 Name | 📦 Version | 📄 Description          |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **ScyllaDB** |  6.1.1  | ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database being utilized as the primary database in the employee application |

## 🌐 Important Ports

| 🔌 Inbound Traffic | 📄 Description           |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **9042**           | Used by ScyllaDB |

## 📥 Step-by-step Installation

# Best Practices
| Practice                  | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Go Modules**       | Always use modules for dependency management. This allows for versioning and better isolation.  |
| **Organize Code**        | Follow Go's conventions for project structure: place code in `pkg`, `cmd`, `internal`, etc.     |
| **Cross-Compile as Needed** | Utilize cross-compilation to build binaries for different platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows).     |
| **Automate Builds**      | Use CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions or Travis CI) to automate the compilation process.     |

# Recommendation
**go build**
- Use Go Modules: Always initialize projects with Go modules for better dependency management.
- Leverage Build Flags: Utilize flags like -o for output names and -ldflags for linker options to customize builds.
- Automate with CI/CD: Integrate go build into CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent and efficient builds across environments.

# Conclusion
The go build command is a fundamental tool in the Go development workflow, enabling developers to compile their applications efficiently. By following best practices and recommendations, such as using Go modules, optimizing build flags, and leveraging cross-compilation, developers can enhance their build processes and ensure consistent, high-quality application performance across various platforms.
