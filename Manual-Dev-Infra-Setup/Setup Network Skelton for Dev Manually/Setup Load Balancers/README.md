## üìú Purpose
This document provides guidance on setting up **AWS Load Balancers** to distribute incoming traffic efficiently across multiple instances and services within a VPC. Load balancers help in optimizing resource usage, reducing latency, and ensuring high availability.

---

## üìñ Introduction
**AWS Load Balancers** play a crucial role in managing traffic for applications deployed within an AWS VPC. By evenly distributing incoming requests across multiple resources, load balancers enhance application resilience, scalability, and performance. Here, both **External** and **Internal Load Balancers** are configured to handle public and internal traffic, respectively.

---

## üîë Key Features of Load Balancers

- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamically scales to handle varying loads, optimizing application performance and availability.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors the health of attached instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
- **Multi-Layer Load Balancing**: Supports load balancing across both the application (Layer 7) and network (Layer 4) layers.
- **Secure Traffic Management**: Integrates with AWS Security Groups for secure routing and manages SSL/TLS certificates.

---

## üéØ Benefits of Using Load Balancers

- **Improved Resilience**: Balances traffic to reduce the load on individual instances, enhancing system resilience.
- **Increased Availability**: Redirects traffic to healthy instances, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Allows efficient utilization of resources by evenly distributing traffic.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports seamless integration with internal and external services, creating a scalable and secure infrastructure.

## üõ† Setup Load Balancers for DEV-Infra

### External Load Balancer
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Console.
2. Under **Load Balancing**, select **Load Balancers** and click **Create Load Balancer**.
3. Choose **Application Load Balancer** and set **Scheme** to **Internet-facing** for public access.
4. Attach this load balancer to the appropriate VPC and select the subnets associated with the public endpoints.
5. Configure **Listeners**:
   - Set up HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) listeners to direct traffic to the **Frontend**, **Attendance**, **Employee**, and **Salary APIs**.
6. Define **Security Groups** for public access, allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from necessary IP ranges.

### Internal Load Balancer
1. From the **Load Balancers** section, create another **Application Load Balancer**.
2. Choose **Scheme** as **Internal** for routing traffic between applications within the VPC.
3. Attach to the VPC and select private subnets for internal communication.
4. Configure **Listeners**:
   - For example, configure HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) listeners as needed for internal routing.
5. Define **Security Groups** for internal access, restricting traffic to only internal IP ranges and applications.

### Attachment to Resources
1. **Register Targets**: Under **Target Groups**, create and register EC2 instances for each application (Attendance, Employee, Salary APIs) and Frontend.
2. Attach the External Load Balancer to **Frontend, Attendance, Employee, and Salary APIs** for public traffic.
3. Attach the Internal Load Balancer to handle communication between **Frontend** and **backend services** for secure internal routing.

## üîö Conclusion

AWS Load Balancers offer an efficient solution to distribute incoming and internal traffic across instances and services within the VPC, ensuring resilience, scalability, and high availability for critical applications.
