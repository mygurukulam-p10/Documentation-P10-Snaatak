## üìú Purpose
This document provides guidance on setting up **AWS Load Balancers** to distribute incoming traffic efficiently across multiple instances and services within a VPC. Load balancers help in optimizing resource usage, reducing latency, and ensuring high availability.

---

## üìñ Introduction
**AWS Load Balancers** play a crucial role in managing traffic for applications deployed within an AWS VPC. By evenly distributing incoming requests across multiple resources, load balancers enhance application resilience, scalability, and performance. Here, both **External** and **Internal Load Balancers** are configured to handle public and internal traffic, respectively.

---

## üîë Key Features of Load Balancers

- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamically scales to handle varying loads, optimizing application performance and availability.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors the health of attached instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
- **Multi-Layer Load Balancing**: Supports load balancing across both the application (Layer 7) and network (Layer 4) layers.
- **Secure Traffic Management**: Integrates with AWS Security Groups for secure routing and manages SSL/TLS certificates.

---

## üéØ Benefits of Using Load Balancers

- **Improved Resilience**: Balances traffic to reduce the load on individual instances, enhancing system resilience.
- **Increased Availability**: Redirects traffic to healthy instances, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Allows efficient utilization of resources by evenly distributing traffic.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports seamless integration with internal and external services, creating a scalable and secure infrastructure.

5. Configure **Listeners**:
   - Set up HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) listeners to direct traffic to the **Frontend**, **Attendance**, **Employee**, and **Salary APIs**.

### Attachment to Resources
1. **Register Targets**: Under **Target Groups**, create and register EC2 instances for each application (Attendance, Employee, Salary APIs) and Frontend.
