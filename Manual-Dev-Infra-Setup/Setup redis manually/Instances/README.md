## üõ† Setup Redis Instance on AWS

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Open the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Instances** and click **Launch Instances**.
   - Choose the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on your requirements (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).
   - Select an instance type suitable for Redis (e.g., t2.micro for testing, larger instances for production).

2. **Instance Configuration**:
   - Configure **Network** and **Subnet** based on your VPC setup.
   - Assign an **Elastic IP** (optional) if you need a static IP address.

3. **Storage and Tags**:
   - Allocate sufficient **storage** as per your needs, and tag the instance for easy identification.
