## 🌟 Introduction

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you make sure you have the right number of servers (EC2 instances) running to handle your application's needs. You set rules for the minimum, maximum, and ideal number of instances you want in an Auto Scaling group. Based on how busy your application gets, Auto Scaling will automatically add more instances when needed or remove them when demand goes down. This way, you only pay for the resources you actually need while keeping your application running smoothly without overloading or wasting resources.
