## Introduction

An instance in Amazon EC2 is essentially a virtual server that users can create and manage within the AWS cloud. These instances are configurable with varying amounts of CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources, allowing users to tailor them to specific application requirements. Instances are launched from pre-configured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which serve as templates containing the necessary operating system and software configurations. Users can start, stop, terminate, and resize instances as needed, providing scalability and flexibility to accommodate changing workloads and demands. Instances play a vital role in enabling users to deploy and run their applications and services in a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective manner on the AWS platform.

## Why use AWS EC2 Instance

| Feature               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operating System**      | Supports various OSes including Linux, Microsoft Windows Server, CentOS, and Debian.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Persistent Storage**    | Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) allows attaching block-level storage volumes to EC2 instances, enabling resizing and attachment to multiple instances simultaneously.                                                         |
| **Elastic IP Addresses**  | Elastic IP service allows associating IP addresses with instances, facilitating easy movement between instances without network administrator intervention. Suitable for failover clusters, load balancing, etc.      |
| **Amazon CloudWatch**     | Monitoring service for collecting, storing, and analyzing historical and real-time performance data of AWS cloud services and applications. Helps optimize costs, resource usage, and scaling based on workload changes.            |
| **Bare-metal Instances** | Virtual servers without virtualization overhead, providing direct access to hardware resources for enhanced security and processing power.                                                                                             |
| **Pause and Resume**      | Allows pausing and resuming instances from the same state, useful for optimizing resource usage and avoiding charges during inactivity.                                                                                               |

## Steps to Launch an Ec2 Instance

  **Step-1 :** Go to the AWS console and sign into your account first.
 
  **Step-2 :** After logging into the Amazon Management Console, visit the EC2 Dashboard .
 
  **Step-3 :** Choose `Launch Instance` from the panel.

> [!NOTE]
> * After successfully launching the instance follow this [**Link**](https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/blob/main/OT%20Micro%20Services/Application/Frontend/README.md) to setup Frontend-API.

> [!Important]
> * After configuring Load-Balancer, use the DNS of the load-balancer and hit in web browser, you wil see the  
  UI of Frontend-API.
> * Please note that before hitting the DNS, the machine active and `npm start` commands should be run. [**DNS**](http://dev-alb-1442510364.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/)

### After hitting the DNS
