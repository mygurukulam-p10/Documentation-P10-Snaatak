## 🔍 Introduction

This document gives an overview of how authentication works in Jenkins. Jenkins is an open-source server that helps automate building, testing, and deploying software. To keep Jenkins safe, it uses **authentication** (to verify user identity) and **authorization** (to control what users can do).

---

## ❓ What is Authentication in Jenkins?

Authentication is about checking who a user is. In Jenkins, users must authenticate (prove who they are) to access or interact with the Jenkins server.

## 🛡️ Why is Authentication Important?

| Reason                          | Explanation |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Security**                     | Makes sure only the right people access Jenkins. |
| **Control Access**               | Ensures users can only see and do what they are allowed to. |
| **Auditing and Tracking**        | Logs user actions for tracking and troubleshooting. |
| **Integration with Other Tools** | Allows Jenkins to securely interact with external tools. |
| **Compliance**                   | Helps meet security requirements and standards. |

## 🔑 Authentication Methods

Jenkins has several ways to handle user login:

| Method                           | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Jenkins Database**              | Users log in with a username and password stored in Jenkins. |
| **LDAP (e.g., Active Directory)** | Uses existing company credentials to log in. |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**          | Log in once for multiple services using SAML or OAuth. |
| **API Token**                     | Users generate tokens for secure API access. |
| **SSH Keys**                      | Log in using SSH keys, often used with Git. |
| **OpenID Connect**                | Log in via third-party providers like Google. |
| **Third-Party Plugins**           | More authentication options through plugins. |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

| Limitation            | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Limited Integration**| Jenkins’ built-in database is not always the best for large teams. |
| **Scalability**        | Larger companies may need more scalable authentication methods like LDAP or SAML. |
| **Security**           | External providers often offer stronger, centralized security. |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

To keep Jenkins secure, follow these tips:

| Practice                          | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Use Strong Passwords**           | Require complex passwords to improve security. |
| **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication** | Add another layer of security with MFA. |
| **Rotate Credentials Regularly**   | Change passwords and tokens frequently. |
| **Limit User Privileges**          | Only give users the permissions they need. |
| **Monitor User Activity**          | Keep an eye on logs for suspicious behavior. |
| **Update Jenkins and Plugins**     | Regularly update Jenkins to keep it secure. |

## 🔄 Types of Authentication in Jenkins

Here are different ways to prove the concept of authentication in Jenkins:

| Type                     | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **LDAP Authentication**    | Uses existing directory services like Active Directory. |
| **GitHub Authentication**  | Log in using GitHub credentials (OAuth). |
| **Google Authentication**  | Log in using Google credentials (OAuth). |
| **SAML Authentication**    | Uses Single Sign-On (SSO) through SAML. |
| **OpenID Connect**         | Log in using OpenID Connect providers. |
| **Custom Authentication**  | Implement specific methods based on your organization's needs. |

## 🧪 POC: Setting up Authentication

### 1. Install GitHub Authentication Plugin
- Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
- Search for and install **GitHub Authentication Plugin**.

### 2. Configure GitHub Authentication
- Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure Global Security**.
- Under **Security Realm**, choose **GitHub Authentication Plugin**.
- Set up an OAuth app on GitHub and enter the required info:
    - **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from GitHub.
    - **Authorization Callback URL** to Jenkins
    -
