### What is Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It offers a variety of tools and plugins to streamline these processes, including security configurations for managing user authentication and authorization.


### Authentication in Jenkins

Authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the Jenkins system. Jenkins supports multiple authentication methods


|Method               | Description                                                               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal User Database**        | Jenkins stores and manages user credentials locally. |
| **LDAP**            | Integrates with directory services like Active Directory.     |
| **OAuth**    | Connects with identity providers like Google or GitHub. |
| **SAML**      |  Enables Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML protocols. |


### Authorization in Jenkins

| Type              | Description                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|      **Matrix-based Security**    | Fine-grained access control over various operations.          |
|     **Role-based Strategy**       | Define roles for users and groups, allowing specific actions at different levels (global, folder, project).     |
| **Project-based Matrix**     | Grants permissions based on specific projects.        |


### Why Secure Jenkins

Securing Jenkins is essential to protect sensitive assets like source code, credentials, and deployment pipelines. Properly configured authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only permitted users can perform critical actions.


### Jenkins Security Best Practices

| **Features** |     **Desciption**   |
|------------- |----------------------|
| **Enable Authentication** | Always enforce user authentication. |
| **Use Role-based Access** | Assign users the least privilege required. |
| **Review Permissions**  | Periodically audit and adjust user permissions. |
| **Enable HTTPS** |  Use TLS/SSL to secure all communications. |
| **Use API Tokens** | Prefer API tokens over passwords for programmatic access.|

 ### Conclusion
 
Authentication and authorization in Jenkins are crucial for protecting your CI/CD pipeline. By configuring WebUI and CLI-based authentication, along with robust authorization strategies, you can ensure the security and integrity of your Jenkins environment.
