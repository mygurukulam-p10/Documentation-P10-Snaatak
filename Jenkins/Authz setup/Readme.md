## 📜 Introduction

This documentation outlines the various authorization methods in Jenkins, an open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying software.

To secure your Jenkins environment, you need to configure two key components:

1. **Authentication** (who can access) 👥
2. **Authorization** (what they can do once inside) 🔒

---

## 🔍 What is Authorization?

Authorization controls **what users are allowed to do** in Jenkins, based on the permissions assigned to their roles or group memberships.

---

## 🔒 Why Authorization Matters

Implementing proper authorization in Jenkins is critical for maintaining security and controlling access within your CI/CD environment.

| **Reason**                  | **Description**                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**           | Restricts access based on user roles.                       |
| **Security**                 | Prevents unauthorized users from making changes.            |
| **Compliance**               | Ensures that you meet regulatory standards.                 |
| **Configuration Control**    | Controls who can modify jobs and settings.                  |
| **Resource Control**         | Regulates access to agents or nodes.                        |

## ⚙️ Authorization Options

Jenkins provides several strategies for managing user permissions:

| **Method**                         | **Description**                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anyone can do anything**          | Full control to all users, including anonymous ones. Ideal for testing only.      |
| **Legacy mode**                     | Admins have full control, others only read access. Useful for older Jenkins versions. |
| **Logged in users can do anything** | Full control to logged-in users; anonymous users get no access or read-only.      |
| **Matrix-based security**           | Fine-grained control over who can perform actions in Jenkins.                    |
| **Project-based Matrix Security**   | Adds project-specific permissions on top of matrix-based security.               |
| **Role-based Authorization**        | Assigns roles with specific permissions to users or groups.                      |

## 🛡️ Role-based Authorization Strategy

A **Role-based Authorization Strategy** allows you to manage Jenkins permissions by assigning roles to users or groups.

| **Feature**                  | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Granular Permissions**      | Define specific permissions for each role.                   |
| **Least Privilege Principle** | Assign only necessary permissions to reduce risks.           |
| **Centralized Management**    | Manage roles from one location, making it scalable.          |
| **Project-Specific Roles**    | Define roles for individual projects, tailored to their needs. |
| **Collaboration**             | Assign roles based on responsibilities, encouraging team collaboration. |

## 🏆 Best Practices

To ensure effective authorization in Jenkins, follow these best practices:

| **Practice**                    | **Description**                                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Role-Based Access Control**| Assign permissions based on roles. Review and update regularly. |
| **Least Privilege Principle**    | Grant only the permissions needed for each user's role.         |
| **Use Groups**                   | Simplify access control by managing user groups.               |
| **Audit Access**                 | Regularly track who accesses Jenkins and what they do.         |
| **Regularly Review Permissions** | Update permissions based on users' changing responsibilities.   |
| **Implement Approval Workflows** | Add approval steps for critical actions to reduce risks.        |
| **Test Permissions**             | Periodically test that your permissions are properly configured. |
| **Backup Authorization Settings**| Backup configurations to quickly restore them if needed.       |

## ⚠️ Common Configuration Mistakes

Avoid these common mistakes when configuring authorization in Jenkins:

1. **Overly Permissive Access**: Giving too much control to users.
2. **Ignoring Least Privilege**: Assigning more permissions than necessary.
3. **Failure to Audit**: Not tracking user actions regularly.

     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbf9e5ec-fd78-43a6-83ad-27c6fe44a956)

   This is the default view for Role-based Configuration settings.
         
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/385d754a-fa39-475e-a9bb-0126b33672c2)

I created two new roles for my users and attached the permissions for these roles. don’t forget to Save and Apply.

After creating the roles, assign them to users.
Go to Assign Roles > Add User > Select the roles.
