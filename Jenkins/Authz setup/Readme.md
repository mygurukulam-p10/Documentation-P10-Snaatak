## 📜 Introduction

This documentation outlines the various authorization methods in Jenkins, an open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying software.

To secure your Jenkins environment, you need to configure two key components:

1. **Authentication** (who can access) 👥
2. **Authorization** (what they can do once inside) 🔒

## 🔍 What is Authorization?

Authorization controls **what users are allowed to do** in Jenkins, based on the permissions assigned to their roles or group memberships.

## 🔒 Why Authorization Matters

Implementing proper authorization in Jenkins is critical for maintaining security and controlling access within your CI/CD environment.

| **Reason**                  | **Description**                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**           | Restricts access based on user roles.                       |
| **Security**                 | Prevents unauthorized users from making changes.            |
| **Compliance**               | Ensures that you meet regulatory standards.                 |
| **Configuration Control**    | Controls who can modify jobs and settings.                  |
| **Resource Control**         | Regulates access to agents or nodes.                        |

## ⚙️ Authorization Options

Jenkins provides several strategies for managing user permissions:

| **Method**                         | **Description**                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anyone can do anything**          | Full control to all users, including anonymous ones. Ideal for testing only.      |
| **Legacy mode**                     | Admins have full control, others only read access. Useful for older Jenkins versions. |
| **Logged in users can do anything** | Full control to logged-in users; anonymous users get no access or read-only.      |
| **Matrix-based security**           | Fine-grained control over who can perform actions in Jenkins.                    |
| **Project-based Matrix Security**   | Adds project-specific permissions on top of matrix-based security.               |
| **Role-based Authorization**        | Assigns roles with specific permissions to users or groups.                      |

## 🛡️ Role-based Authorization Strategy

A **Role-based Authorization Strategy** allows you to manage Jenkins permissions by assigning roles to users or groups.

| **Feature**                  | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Granular Permissions**      | Define specific permissions for each role.                   |
| **Least Privilege Principle** | Assign only necessary permissions to reduce risks.           |
| **Centralized Management**    | Manage roles from one location, making it scalable.          |
| **Project-Specific Roles**    | Define roles for individual projects, tailored to their needs. |
| **Collaboration**             | Assign roles based on responsibilities, encouraging team collaboration. |

## 🏆 Best Practices

To ensure effective authorization in Jenkins, follow these best practices:

| **Practice**                    | **Description**                                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Role-Based Access Control**| Assign permissions based on roles. Review and update regularly. |
| **Least Privilege Principle**    | Grant only the permissions needed for each user's role.         |
| **Use Groups**                   | Simplify access control by managing user groups.               |
| **Audit Access**                 | Regularly track who accesses Jenkins and what they do.         |
| **Regularly Review Permissions** | Update permissions based on users' changing responsibilities.   |
| **Implement Approval Workflows** | Add approval steps for critical actions to reduce risks.        |
| **Test Permissions**             | Periodically test that your permissions are properly configured. |
| **Backup Authorization Settings**| Backup configurations to quickly restore them if needed.       |
