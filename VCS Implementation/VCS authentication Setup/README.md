### Generating and Using SSH Keys 

Open terminal on your Machine and run below command to **generate ssh public and private key** which by default get added to **.ssh** directory of the user. Simply hit enter for the prompt or you can define your own values if needed.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Add the Public Key to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**

See and copy content of your public SSH key with below command
 
``` 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
