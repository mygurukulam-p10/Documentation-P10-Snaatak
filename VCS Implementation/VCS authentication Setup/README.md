Complete Enablement.


##  Setting Up GitHub Authentication for CLI Access

### Generating and Using SSH Keys 

Open terminal on your Machine and run below command to **generate ssh public and private key** which by default get added to **.ssh** directory of the user. Simply hit enter for the prompt or you can define your own values if needed.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Add the Public Key to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**

See and copy content of your public SSH key with below command
 
``` 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a6f6659-d826-45b2-972e-8347ea6ca99a)

Paste it in your Git accounts, at SSH key section which you can find in settings of your account.

**Try cloning any Repository with ssh Option**

Copy SSH URL 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37840952-add4-427e-bee8-d6d0a8b2b0ef)

Now when you clone the repo it won't ask for password and will provide secure login with SSH.

##  Conclusion

By using 2FA for web access and SSH for CLI access, we can significantly improve the security of your GitHub account. This combination provides a strong defense against unauthorized access.
