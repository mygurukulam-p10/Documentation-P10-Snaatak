## Introduction
Automating the process of building and deploying Go applications can be efficiently done using Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. Declarative Pipelines in Jenkins allow for structured and readable automation scripts, making the entire Go code compilation process easier to manage and understand.

## Pre-requisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following tools:
1. **Jenkins**: Ensure you have a Jenkins instance running.
2. **Go Plugin**: Ensure you have Go Plugin is configured.
