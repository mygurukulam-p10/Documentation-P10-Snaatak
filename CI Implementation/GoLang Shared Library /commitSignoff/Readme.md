## Jenkinsfile
```
def call(String recipientEmail, String repoURL, String branchName) {
    try {
        // Get the last commit message
        def lastCommitMessage = sh(script: 'git log -1 --pretty=%B', returnStdout: true).trim()

        // Check if the commit contains "Signed-off-by:"
        if (!lastCommitMessage.contains("Signed-off-by:")) {
            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
            error("Commit is not signed off. Please sign off your commit.")
        } else {
            echo "Commit is signed off."
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Mark build as failure in case of any exception
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        echo "An error occurred: ${e.message}"
    } finally {
        // Prepare email subject based on build result
        def emailSubject = "Build Status: ${currentBuild.result} - Job ${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]"
        
        // Prepare email body with dynamic content
        def emailBody = """The current build result is: ${currentBuild.result}
                        Branch: ${branchName}
                        Repository: ${repoURL}
                        Build Number: ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}
                        ${currentBuild.result == 'FAILURE' ? "Error Message: ${e?.message ?: 'N/A'}" : "Build was successful!"}"""

        // Send email notification
        emailext(
            to: recipientEmail,
            subject: emailSubject,
            body: emailBody
        )
    }
}

## 🏁 Conclusion

The commit signoff process is crucial for maintaining code quality and accountability in software development. It ensures that contributors acknowledge the project's contribution guidelines and take responsibility for their changes. By including a "Signed-off-by" line in your commits, you facilitate a transparent development process and uphold the integrity of the codebase.
