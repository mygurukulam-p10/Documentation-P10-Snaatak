### Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to integrating static code analysis using a **Jenkins Shared Library** within a Jenkins pipeline. The shared library enables code reuse and enforces coding standards across multiple projects. It simplifies static code analysis by encapsulating common logic into reusable Groovy scripts.

---

## Requirements

To successfully set up static code analysis using the shared library in Jenkins, ensure the following dependencies are met:

| Dependency      | Version       | Description                                                              |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python3**     | >= 3.6        | Required for running static analysis tools in a Python environment.       |
| **pip**         | Latest        | Python's package manager, essential for managing dependencies.           |
| **pylint**      | Latest        | Static analysis tool for enforcing coding standards and detecting errors. |
| **Jenkins Shared Library** | Latest | A reusable library to automate static code analysis.                  |

## Setting Up Static Code Analysis with Shared Library

This section outlines the steps to configure a Jenkins job for static code analysis using a shared library, from job creation to pipeline configuration.

### Jenkins Job Configuration

1. **Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard:**  
   Start by logging into Jenkins and going to the main dashboard.

2. **Create a New Job:**  
   - Click on **New Item**.

4. **Source Control Setup:**  
   - Link the job to your source control repository containing the Jenkinsfile that uses the shared library for pipeline configuration.

5. **Pipeline Configuration:**  
   - Use the shared library in the Jenkinsfile to invoke static code analysis. The shared library ensures consistent analysis across all projects.

## Reviewing and Interpreting the Static Code Analysis Report

The static code analysis report provides a summary of detected issues, including:

- **Error Types:** Categorized as ERROR, WARNING, REFACTOR, or CONVENTION, representing the severity and type of coding standards.
- **File and Line Number:** Shows the exact location of the issue in the codebase.
- **Issue Description:** Provides a brief description of each detected issue.
- **Suggested Improvements:** Offers guidance on how to resolve the identified issues.

## Conclusion

Integrating static code analysis through a Jenkins shared library streamlines the process across multiple projects, ensuring consistent coding standards and helping maintain code quality across the board. This approach supports efficient development practices, making the codebase more maintainable and robust.
