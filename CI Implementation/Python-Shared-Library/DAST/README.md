### Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to integrating dynamic application security testing (DAST) using **OWASP ZAP** within a Jenkins pipeline. The shared library facilitates code reuse and establishes security standards across multiple projects, automating the DAST process through reusable Groovy scripts.

---

## Requirements

To successfully set up DAST using the shared library in Jenkins, ensure the following dependencies are met:

| Dependency                       | Version       | Description                                                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Java**                         | 8 or higher   | Required for running OWASP ZAP.                                      |
| **OWASP ZAP**                   | Latest        | Dynamic application security scanner to find vulnerabilities.        |
| **Jenkins Shared Library**       | Latest        | A reusable library to automate DAST processes.                       |

## Setting Up Dynamic Application Security Testing with Shared Library

This section outlines the steps to configure a Jenkins job for dynamic application security testing using a shared library, from job creation to pipeline configuration.

### Jenkins Job Configuration

1. **Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard:**  
   Start by logging into Jenkins and going to the main dashboard.

2. **Create a New Job:**  
   - Click on **New Item**.

3. **Add Description:**  
   - Include a detailed job description.

4. **Source Control Setup:**  
   - Link the job to your source control repository containing the Jenkinsfile that uses the shared library for pipeline configuration.

5. **Pipeline Configuration:**  
   - Use the shared library in the Jenkinsfile to invoke DAST using OWASP ZAP. The shared library ensures consistent testing across all projects.

#### Report
After pipeline execution, a report generated by OWASP ZAP will be available, detailing detected vulnerabilities and suggested mitigations.

## Reviewing and Interpreting the DAST Report

The DAST report provides a summary of detected vulnerabilities, including:

- **Vulnerability Types:** Categorized as High, Medium, or Low severity based on potential impact.
- **URL:** The location of the vulnerability in the application.
- **Description:** A brief summary of each detected issue.
- **Recommended Actions:** Suggestions on how to remediate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Integrating dynamic application security testing through a Jenkins shared library using OWASP ZAP streamlines the process of identifying vulnerabilities in your application. This approach helps maintain secure coding practices and promotes a culture of security awareness within development teams.
