### 💥 Introduction
This Readme.md provides Dependency scanning is crucial for identifying security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by a project. Integrating this into a CI/CD pipeline ensures that only secure dependencies are used, helping to prevent potential security threats. This process is vital for maintaining overall application security.
