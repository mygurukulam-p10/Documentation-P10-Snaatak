### 💥 Introduction
This document outlines how to set up a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline specifically for Java Unit Testing. Jenkins, as a popular automation server, supports a variety of build configurations.


## ⚙ Pre-requisites
1. **Jenkins**: Ensure you have a Jenkins instance running.
2. **Java**: Required to run the built Java application.
3. **Maven**: Simplifies build management
4. **JUnit**: A necessary library for executing the unit tests.

## 🔍 System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Processor**     | Dual-core CPU             | 
| **Memory**        | 2 GB RAM                  | 
| **Disk Space**    | 10 GB                      | 
| **OS**            |Ubuntu 22.04 LTS           |

## 💥 Steps to Configuration Declarative pipelines for Unit Testing

### 1. 🚀 Open your Jenkins Dashboard.

## 📛 Conclusion

We run the code using command mvn test and found apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0 error. By using unit tests into the development lifecycle, you can ensure code reliability, early bug detection, and maintainability. Tools like Maven and JUnit, along with best practices such as isolating tests and automating the testing process, significantly improve software quality. The continuous integration setup automates the testing process, ensuring that any new changes do not break existing functionality.
