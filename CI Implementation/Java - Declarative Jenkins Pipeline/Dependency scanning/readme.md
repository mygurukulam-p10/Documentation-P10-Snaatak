### 💥 Introduction
This document outlines how to set up a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline for Dependency scanning. Dependency scanning is a crucial aspect of modern software development, ensuring the security and reliability of your projects. This process involves identifying and managing the third-party libraries and frameworks your project depends on


## ⚙ Pre-requisites
1. **Jenkins**: Ensure you have a Jenkins instance running.
2. **Java**: Required to run the built Java application.
3. **Maven**: Simplifies build management
4. **OWASP Dependency-Check**:	A software composition analysis tool that identifies project dependencies and checks for known vulnerabilities.

## 🔍 System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Processor**     | Dual-core CPU             | 
| **Memory**        | 2 GB RAM                  | 
| **Disk Space**    | 10 GB                      | 
| **OS**            |Ubuntu 22.04 LTS           |


## 💥 Steps to Configuration Declarative pipelines for Dependency scanning
### To enable the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin in your Maven project, add the following configuration to your pom.xml file. Ensure this configuration is placed within the <build> section
```
            <!-- Add the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
                <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
                <version>10.0.4</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>check</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

### 1. 🚀 Open your Jenkins Dashboard.
