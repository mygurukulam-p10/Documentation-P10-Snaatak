### 💥 Introduction
This document outlines how to set up a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline for DAST using OWASP ZAP, an open-source security tool. This Proof of Concept (PoC) will demonstrate how DAST can help detect and fix security issues to make web application more secure before it's launched.


## ⚙ Pre-requisites
1. **Jenkins**: Ensure you have a Jenkins instance running.
2. **Java**: Required to run the built Java application.
3. **Maven**: Simplifies build management
4. **OWASP ZAP**:	Open source web application security scanner.

## 🔍 System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Processor**     | Dual-core CPU             | 
| **Memory**        | 2 GB RAM                  | 
| **Disk Space**    | 10 GB                      | 
| **OS**            |Ubuntu 22.04 LTS           |


## 💥 Steps to Configuration Declarative pipelines for DAST

### 1. 🚀 Open your Jenkins Dashboard.

### 2. 🚀 Click on **New Item**.** ---> **Enter a name for your job (e.g., `DAST`).

### 3. 🚀 Provide a description for the pipeline that performs DAST.

### 4. 🚀 Choose Pipeline as the job type-->Add your pipeline script for DAST in the pipeline configuration...>Click on Save to store the configuration.



### 5. 🚀 Then Click on build to run the pipeline to perform

### 6.🚀 Now we are able to see build complete-

### 7.🚀 Click on Console Output to see the complete build.




### 9.🚀 Review the stages of the build process in the console output.


## 📛 Conclusion
In this Proof of Concept (PoC), OWASP ZAP was used to perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) on the salary-api application. The testing revealed several security issues, including the absence of a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. CSP helps protect the application against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by allowing developers to specify which sources of content are safe to load.
