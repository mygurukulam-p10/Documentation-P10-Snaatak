### 💥 Introduction
This document outlines how to set up a Shared Library for Bugs analysis in Java. Jenkins, as a popular automation server, supports a variety of build configurations. Static code analysis is the process of examining source code without executing it to identify potential issues, improve quality.

## ⚙ Pre-requisites
1. **Jenkins**: Ensure you have a Jenkins instance running.
2. **Java**: Required to run the built Java application.
3. **Maven**: Simplifies build management
4. **Tools for Static Code Analysis** [here](https://github.com/mygurukulam-p10/Documentation-P10-Snaatak/tree/main/Application%20CI%20Design/Java%20CI%20checks/Static%20Code%20Analysis%20Doc).

## 🔍 System Requirements Here[https://github.com/mygurukulam-p10/Documentation-P10-Snaatak/blob/main/CI%20Implementation/Java%20-%20Declarative%20Jenkins%20Pipeline/Static%20code%20analysis/readme.md#-system-requirements]

### 2. 🚀 Click on **New Item**.** ---> **Enter a name for your job (e.g., `Static Code Analysis`).


### 3. 🚀 Provide a description for the pipeline in detail what will perform.



### 4. 🚀 Create the repo for add src & vars file which will be using in pipeline script.



### 5. 🚀 Choose Pipeline as the job type-->Add your pipeline script for Static Code Analysis in the pipeline script ...> add repo link & credintial, file path.



### 6. 🚀 Then Click on build to run the pipeline to perform
