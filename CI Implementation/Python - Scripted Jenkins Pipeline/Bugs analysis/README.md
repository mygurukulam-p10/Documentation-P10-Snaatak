## 📈 Reviewing and Interpreting the Bandit Report

After the pipeline execution, a `txt` report generated by Bandit will be available as an artifact in Jenkins. The report provides insights into detected security issues, including:

- **Severity Level:** Each issue is categorized as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, indicating the potential risk.
- **File and Line Number:** Shows the exact location of the issue in the codebase.
- **Issue Confidence:** Measures the confidence level of the finding (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
- **Recommendation:** Provides guidance for resolving the identified security vulnerabilities.

## 📌 Conclusion

Integrating Bandit into a Jenkins pipeline enhances the security and reliability of the Attendance API microservice by continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities. This approach ensures that any security risks in the codebase are promptly identified and addressed, reinforcing safe development practices.
