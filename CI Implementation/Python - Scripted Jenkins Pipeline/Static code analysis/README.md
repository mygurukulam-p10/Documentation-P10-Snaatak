## ⚡ Requirements

To successfully set up static code analysis using pylint in Jenkins, ensure the following dependencies are met:

| Dependency      | Version       | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python3**     | >= 3.6        | Required for running pylint in a Python environment.                    |
| **pip**         | Latest        | Python's package manager, essential for managing dependencies.          |
| **pylint**      | Latest        | Static analysis tool for enforcing coding standards and detecting errors.|

4. **Source Control Setup:**  
   - Link the job to your source control repository that contains the Jenkinsfile for pipeline configuration.


5. **Choose Pipeline as the job type** → Add your pipeline script for static code analysis under the Pipeline section → Provide the repository link, credentials, and file path.

6. **Click on Build** to initiate the pipeline.

7. **Observe as the build completes.**

8. **Review the Console Output** for build details.

9. **Check each stage in the console output for successful completion.**

10. **Check the pylint report generated during the scan.**

#### Report
After pipeline execution, a text report generated by pylint will be available as an artifact in Jenkins.

## 📈 Reviewing and Interpreting the pylint Report

The pylint report provides a summary of detected issues, including:

- **Error Types:** Categorized as ERROR, WARNING, REFACTOR, or CONVENTION, representing the severity and type of coding standards.
- **File and Line Number:** Shows the exact location of the issue in the codebase.
- **Issue Description:** Provides a brief description of each detected issue.
- **Suggested Improvements:** Offers guidance on how to resolve the identified issues.

## 📌 Conclusion

Integrating pylint into a Jenkins pipeline helps ensure code quality by enforcing consistent coding standards and highlighting potential issues in the Attendance API microservice. This approach supports safe and efficient development practices, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.
