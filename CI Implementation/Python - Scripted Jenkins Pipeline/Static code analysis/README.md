## ⚡ Requirements

To successfully set up static code analysis using pylint in Jenkins, ensure the following dependencies are met:

| Dependency      | Version       | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python3**     | >= 3.6        | Required for running pylint in a Python environment.                    |
| **pip**         | Latest        | Python's package manager, essential for managing dependencies.          |
| **pylint**      | Latest        | Static analysis tool for enforcing coding standards and detecting errors.|

## 📈 Reviewing and Interpreting the pylint Report

The pylint report provides a summary of detected issues, including:

- **Error Types:** Categorized as ERROR, WARNING, REFACTOR, or CONVENTION, representing the severity and type of coding standards.
- **File and Line Number:** Shows the exact location of the issue in the codebase.
- **Issue Description:** Provides a brief description of each detected issue.
- **Suggested Improvements:** Offers guidance on how to resolve the identified issues.

## 📌 Conclusion

Integrating pylint into a Jenkins pipeline helps ensure code quality by enforcing consistent coding standards and highlighting potential issues in the Attendance API microservice. This approach supports safe and efficient development practices, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.
