## üìù Introduction
In this document, we will create a new **Amazon EC2 instance** running, and configure it.

### What is an EC2 Instance?
An instance in Amazon EC2 is essentially a virtual server within the AWS cloud, allowing users to manage their applications with flexibility and scalability. Instances are launched from **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**, serving as templates containing the OS and software configurations. You can start, stop, or resize instances as needed.

## üìä EC2 Instance Types

| Instance Type           | Description                                                                 | Common Use Cases                                                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General Purpose**      | Balanced resources for diverse workloads.                                   | Web hosting, dev environments                                                               |
| **Compute Optimized**    | High-performance processors for heavy compute workloads.                    | Scientific modeling, big data processing                                                     |
| **GPU Instances**        | Optimized for graphics-intensive applications.                              | Game development, machine learning                                                          |
| **Memory Optimized**     | High-performance memory for data-heavy applications.                        | Real-time analytics, big data                                                                |
| **Storage Optimized**    | Optimized for high-speed storage applications.                              | Data processing, NoSQL databases                                                             |
| **Micro Instances**      | Low-cost instances for low-throughput applications.                         | Low-traffic web servers, testing environments                                                |

## üåü Why Use AWS EC2 Instance?

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-OS Support**       | Runs various operating systems including Linux, Windows, and more.                              |
| **Elastic Block Storage**  | Persistent block-level storage for your instance that can be resized.                           |
| **Elastic IP**             | Static IP address that can be easily associated or reassigned to instances.                     |
| **Amazon CloudWatch**      | Real-time monitoring and alerts for resource usage and performance.                             |
| **Bare-metal Instances**   | Direct access to hardware without virtualization overhead.                                      |
| **Pause and Resume**       | Pause instances to save costs, and resume when required.                                        |
