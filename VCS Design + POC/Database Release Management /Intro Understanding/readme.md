## Purpose 
Databases store and manage large amounts of data, making it easy to retrieve, update, and search for information. They keep data accurate and secure, and help with detailed reporting and analysis. Databases are used in many areas like business, finance, healthcare, and education to organize data and support decision-making.

## Introduction
Version control for databases is essential for managing changes to database schemas and data. This practice is aim to source code versioning and helps teams manage, track, and deploy database changes effectively. This guide covers the importance of database version control, available tools, detailed comparisons, best practices, and additional resources.

## Why Version Control for Databases?
Version control for databases tackles several key challenges:
| **Feature**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Change Management** | Track and manage changes to database schemas and data over time. Ensure changes are well-documented and reversible. |
| **Collaboration**     | Enable multiple team members to work on database changes simultaneously without conflicts or data loss. |
| **Consistency**       | Maintain consistency across development, staging, and production environments by applying changes in a controlled manner. |
| **Auditability**      | Provide an audit trail of changes, allowing for better tracking of who made changes and why.     |
| **Rollback Capability** | Easily revert to previous versions of the database schema or data if issues arise.              |

## Recommendations
When choosing a database version control tool, consider:
| **Criteria**            | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compatibility**       | Ensure the database platform is compatible with your existing database systems and technology stack.     |
| **Integration Needs**   | Evaluate how well the database integrates with your existing tools and workflows.                        | 
| **Migration Complexity**| Determine the complexity of migrating to the new database, including schema changes and data transfer.    | Hybrid approaches |
| **Budget**              | Choose a database platform based on your budget constraints, considering both initial and ongoing costs.  |

For general use, **Flyway** and **Liquibase** are highly recommended. Flyway is noted for its simplicity, while Liquibase provides advanced features and flexibility.

## Best Practices
