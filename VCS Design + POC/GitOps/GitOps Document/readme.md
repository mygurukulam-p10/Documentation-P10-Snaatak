## Purpose
GitOps is a way to manage and deploy applications by using Git as the main source of truth. It builds on DevOps and Infrastructure as Code principles, making it easier to keep everything in sync and automate updates by tracking changes in Git. Essentially, you use Git to control and manage all aspects of your application's deployment and operation.

## Introduction
GitOps is a powerful approach for managing and deploying applications and infrastructure using Git as the single source of truth. By defining the desired state of the system in Git repositories, GitOps enables automated, reliable, and auditable deployments. This document outlines various GitOps strategies, detailing what they are, why they are important, and how different types of GitOps workflows compare.

## What is GitOps?
GitOps is an operational model that uses Git repositories to manage and control infrastructure and application deployments. It applies Git-based workflows to operations, making Git the central point of truth for system configurations and deployments. GitOps leverages tools and practices that ensure the system's actual state aligns with the desired state defined in Git.


## Why Implement GitOps Strategies?
| **Principle**           | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**         | Ensures that deployments are consistent across different environments by using a single source of truth.         |
| **Automation**          | Reduces manual intervention through automated deployments and synchronization, which improves efficiency.         |
| **Auditability**        | Provides a clear audit trail of changes and deployments, enhancing transparency and traceability.                |
| **Rollback and Recovery** | Facilitates easy rollback to previous states in case of failures or issues, thanks to versioned configurations in Git. |
| **Security**            | Improves security by leveraging Git’s access controls and providing a clear history of changes.                   |


## Types of GitOps Workflow
GitOps workflows can be categorized based on how they handle configuration and deployment processes. Here are the common types:

### 1. Declarative GitOps
-	Description: Configuration and deployment are defined declaratively in Git repositories. The desired state of the system is described using configuration files (e.g., YAML) stored in Git.
-	How It Works: Changes to configuration files trigger automated deployments to align the actual state with the desired state.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD, Flux.
### 2. Pull-Based GitOps
-	Description: The system periodically pulls the latest configuration from Git repositories to ensure the desired state is applied.
-	How It Works: The GitOps tool running in the cluster regularly checks the Git repository for changes and applies them if there are discrepancies.
-	Example Tools: Flux, Argo CD (with periodic sync).
### 3. Push-Based GitOps
-	Description: Changes are pushed to the Git repository, and a webhook or similar mechanism triggers an immediate update to the system.
-	How It Works: The GitOps tool is notified via webhooks or other notifications when changes are made to the Git repository, prompting an immediate deployment.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD (with webhook support).
### 4. Hybrid GitOps
-	Description: Combines elements of both pull-based and push-based GitOps. It may use pull-based synchronization for regular updates and push-based mechanisms for urgent or critical changes.
-	How It Works: Regular synchronization is managed by the pull-based approach, while critical updates can be pushed through notifications or manual triggers.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD (supports both methods), Flux (with additional tooling for push-based triggers).

## Comparison of GitOps Workflows
Here’s a comparison of the different GitOps workflows:

| **Feature**              | **Declarative GitOps**                  | **Pull-Based GitOps**                    | **Push-Based GitOps**                     | **Hybrid GitOps**                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Configuration Definition** | Declarative files in Git                | Declarative files in Git                | Declarative files in Git                 | Declarative files in Git                |
| **Sync Mechanism**       | Automated sync                           | Regular periodic checks                 | Immediate notifications                  | Regular checks + notifications          |
| **Deployment Trigger**   | Changes in Git repository                | Changes in Git repository               | Webhooks or notifications                | Mix of periodic checks and notifications |
| **Tool Examples**        | Argo CD, Flux                            | Flux, Argo CD (with sync)               | Argo CD (with webhooks)                  | Argo CD (with mixed methods)            |
| **Latency**              | Depends on sync interval                 | Periodic updates (variable)             | Immediate                                | Variable, depending on method           |
| **Complexity**           | Moderate                                 | Low to moderate                         | Moderate to high                         | High                                    |


## Conclusion

- Implementing GitOps strategies can greatly enhance the efficiency, consistency, and security of your deployment processes. Each GitOps workflow—declarative, pull-based, push-based, and hybrid—offers unique advantages and trade-offs. Declarative GitOps provides clear, consistent deployments based on configuration files. Pull-based GitOps ensures regular synchronization with the Git repository. Push-based GitOps allows for immediate updates based on changes. Hybrid GitOps combines these approaches to balance regular updates with critical changes.
- Choosing the right GitOps strategy depends on your specific requirements, including the need for immediate updates, the complexity of your deployment environments, and your team's familiarity with the tools.
