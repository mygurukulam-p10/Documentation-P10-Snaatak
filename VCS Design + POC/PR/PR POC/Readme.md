   ![pull-request-flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22e6c8e-dd66-4f03-9683-527d63ef8624)


## Pre-requisites
Before proceeding with the Proof of Concept (POC) for creating a Pull Request (PR), ensure the following prerequisites are met:
**GitHub Account**: A GitHub account is required to create and manage Pull Requests. Ensure that you have an active GitHub account and necessary permissions for the repository you are working on.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Pull Request (PR)
Creating a Pull Request (PR) involves several steps to propose changes to a repository. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you through the process:
1. **Create Repository in git and add the project file**
   - Log in to your Git platform (e.g., GitHub).
   - Navigate to the Repositories section and click on New.
   - Enter a repository name, select its visibility (public or private), and add a description if needed.
   - Click Create Repository. This initializes an empty repository on the Git platform.

2. **After adding the project files, clone the repository to your local system to continue with further development and version control activities.**
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mygurukulam-p10/PR-Demo-Repo.git
   ```

3. **Changes the directory into private.**
   ```
   cd <directory name>
   ```
4. **Create a new branch to implement changes in the project code using the command below.**
 ```
 git checkout -b new_branch
 ```

7. **With the help of below mentioned command we can see the modified change in project file**
   ```
   git status
   ```
