## What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a way to propose changes to a repository in GitHub. It allows developers to contribute to a project by suggesting modifications, which can be reviewed, discussed, and merged into the main codebase by the repository's maintainers. A pull request is an essential tool for collaborating on open-source projects or within teams.

## Features of Pull Requests

1. **Code Review**: Pull requests allow team members or contributors to review code changes before they are merged.

2. **Discussion and Feedback**: Developers can discuss the proposed changes through comments and suggestions.

3. **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and checks to ensure the proposed changes don't break the codebase.

4. **Documentation**: Provides a historical record of what changes were made, why, and by whom.

5. **Merge Control**: Maintainers control when and how code changes are merged into the main branch.

3.  **Tracks Changes**: Helps maintain a record of what changes were made and why.
  
4.  **Enforces Best Practices**: Pull requests can be set up to enforce guidelines and best practices before merging code.

## Steps to Create a Pull Request

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a copy of the repository you want to contribute to.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   
3. **Create a New Branch**: Make changes in a new branch, not directly on the `main` or `master` branch.
   
4. **Commit Your Changes**: After making your changes, commit them with a descriptive message.
   
5. **Push the Changes**: Push your changes to the new branch on your forked repository.
   
6. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
   - Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Select the base branch and the branch where you made your changes.
   - Add a title and description of the changes.
   - Click "Create Pull Request".


## Rules of Pull Requests

1. **Clear Description**: Provide a clear and concise description of the changes.
   
2. **Follow Guidelines**: Ensure that the pull request adheres to the repository's contribution guidelines.
 
3. **Proper Testing**: Ensure that the code changes are properly tested.
 
4. **Small Changes**: Break down large changes into smaller, manageable pull requests.

5. **Respond to Feedback**: Be responsive to feedback and make necessary revisions.
