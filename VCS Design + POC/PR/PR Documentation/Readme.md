### What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a way to propose changes to a repository in GitHub. It allows developers to contribute to a project by suggesting modifications, which can be reviewed, discussed, and merged into the main codebase by the repository's maintainers. A pull request is an essential tool for collaborating on open-source projects or within teams.
