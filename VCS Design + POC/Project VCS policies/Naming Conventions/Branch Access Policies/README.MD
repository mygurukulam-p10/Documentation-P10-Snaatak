# Branch Access Policies
** This document outlines the branch access policies for our version control system (VCS). These policies help safeguard critical branches, ensure code quality, and define who has access to perform actions like merging or pushing directly to branches **.

## 1. Introduction
Branch access policies are mechanisms used to manage and control how developers interact with specific branches in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These policies help maintain the integrity of critical branches (e.g., ``` main```, ``` develop ```) by defining rules about who can push changes, merge pull requests, or delete branches.

## 2. Branch Protection Rules
Branch protection rules are key components in branch access policies. They enforce specific conditions that must be met before changes can be made to protected branches. Common branch protection rules include:

### 2.1 Requiring Pull Requests
- Changes to a protected branch can only be made through pull requests (PRs), rather than direct pushes. This ensures that all changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

### 2.2 Code Review Requirements
- Specifies that a PR must be approved by one or more reviewers before it can be merged into the protected branch. This rule ensures that code quality and consistency are maintained.

### 2.3 Status Checks
- PRs must pass all required status checks before being merged. These checks could include automated tests, continuous integration (CI) checks, or security scans. This ensures that the code is stable and reliable.

### 2.4 Require Signed Commits
- Enforces that all commits to a protected branch must be signed with a valid GPG key. This rule ensures the authenticity of the code by verifying that it came from a trusted source.

### 2.5 Prevent Force-Pushes
- Force pushes allow a developer to overwrite the commit history of a branch, which can be dangerous. This rule prevents force pushes to protected branches, ensuring that the commit history remains intact and traceable.

### 2.6 Prevent Branch Deletion
- This rule prevents users from deleting a protected branch. It’s particularly useful for critical branches like main or production, where accidental deletions could disrupt the entire project.

## 3. Access Policies for Branches
Access policies define who can interact with certain branches and what actions they are allowed to perform. These policies ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify important branches.

### 3.1 Permission Levels
** Read Access ** : Users with read access can view the branch but cannot make changes.

** Write Access ** : Users with write access can push commits to the branch, but they may still be restricted by branch protection rules.

** Admin Access ** : Users with admin access have full control over the branch, including modifying branch protection rules and access permissions.

### 3.2 Team-Based Access Control
You can define access policies based on teams. For example, only the QA team might have write access to the staging branch, while the main branch could be restricted to the devops team for deployments.

### 3.3 Restricting Merges to Specific Users
You can configure access policies so that only certain users (e.g., team leads or senior developers) have the ability to merge pull requests into specific branches, ensuring better oversight.

### 3.4 Environment-Specific Restrictions
For branches that are tied to certain environments (e.g., production or development), access policies can restrict who can push changes to prevent unauthorized deployments or updates.

## 4. Setting Up Branch Protection Rules

- ** Navigate to Settings **: Go to your repository’s settings page.
- ** Select Branches **: Under the "Branches" section, you can configure protection rules.
- ** Create a New Rule **: Choose the branch you want to protect and specify the rules (e.g., require pull requests, enforce status checks, etc.).
- ** Save the Rule **: Once configured, save the rule, and it will immediately go into effect.

## 5. Best Practices for Managing Branch Access Policies

- ** Use Fine-Grained Permissions **: Always follow the principle of least privilege. Only give users the minimum access they need to do their job.
- ** Require Reviews for Critical Branches **: Always enforce peer reviews for critical branches to catch bugs and ensure code quality.
- ** Regularly Review and Update Access Policies **: As your team grows, periodically review your branch access policies to ensure they are still appropriate.
- ** Enforce Consistency Across Teams **: Ensure all teams follow the same protection rules for important branches like main to prevent confusion.

## 6. Conclusion

Branch access policies, including branch protection rules, are crucial for maintaining the quality and stability of a codebase, particularly in a collaborative environment. By enforcing these rules and policies, you reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized changes, improve code quality, and maintain a smooth workflow across your development team.
