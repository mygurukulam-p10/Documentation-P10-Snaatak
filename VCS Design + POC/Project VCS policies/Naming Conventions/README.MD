# ðŸš€ Project VCS Policies

This document outlines the version control system (VCS) policies for managing code in the repository. It includes naming conventions, commit message guidelines, and templates for branches and tags. By following these conventions, we aim to maintain consistency, readability, and traceability across the project.

## ðŸ“› Naming Conventions

To keep our repository clean, organized, and easy to navigate, we have established the following naming conventions for branches, tags, and commits.

### Branch Name Template

Branches are essential for working on isolated features, bug fixes, or experiments. Use a clear naming structure that reflects the purpose of the branch.


#### Branch Types:
- **feature/**: Used for new features or enhancements.
- **bugfix/**: Used for resolving bugs.
- **hotfix/**: Used for urgent, high-priority fixes that need to go directly into production.
- **release/**: Preparing for a new release.
- **test/**: Used for testing purposes or experimentation.



#### Examples:
- `feature/123-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/456-fix-404-error`
- `hotfix/789-critical-bugfix`
- `release/v2.0.0`

### Tag Name Template

Tags mark specific points in the repositoryâ€™s history, typically for releases or important milestones. Use the following template for tags:

#### Examples:
- `v1.0.0`: First major release.
- `v1.1.0`: Minor feature updates and improvements.
- `v1.1.1`: Patch for bug fixes.



#### Commit Types:
- **feat**: New feature or functionality.
- **fix**: Bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no code logic changes).
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without adding new features or fixing bugs.
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests.
- **chore**: Miscellaneous tasks, such as build tasks or dependency updates.
