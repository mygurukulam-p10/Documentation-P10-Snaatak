# Branch Access Policies
** This document outlines the branch access policies for our version control system (VCS). These policies help safeguard critical branches, ensure code quality, and define who has access to perform actions like merging or pushing directly to branches**.

Branch access policies are mechanisms used to manage and control how developers interact with specific branches in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

## Branch Protection Rules
Branch protection rules are key components in branch access policies. They enforce specific conditions that must be met before changes can be made to protected branches. Common branch protection rules include:
