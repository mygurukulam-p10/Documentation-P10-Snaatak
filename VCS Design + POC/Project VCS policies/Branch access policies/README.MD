# Branch Access Policies
This document outlines the branch access policies for our version control system (VCS). These policies help safeguard critical branches, ensure code quality, and define who has access to perform actions like merging or pushing directly to branches.

## Introduction
Branch access policies are mechanisms used to manage and control how developers interact with specific branches in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These policies help maintain the integrity of critical branches (e.g., ``` main```, ``` develop ```) by defining rules about who can push changes, merge pull requests, or delete branches.
