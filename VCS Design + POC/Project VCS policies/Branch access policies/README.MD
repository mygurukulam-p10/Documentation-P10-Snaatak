# Branch Access Policies
** This document outlines the branch access policies for our version control system (VCS). These policies help safeguard critical branches, ensure code quality, and define who has access to perform actions like merging or pushing directly to branches **.

## 1. Introduction
Branch access policies are mechanisms used to manage and control how developers interact with specific branches in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These policies help maintain the integrity of critical branches (e.g., ``` main```, ``` develop ```) by defining rules about who can push changes, merge pull requests, or delete branches.

## 2. Branch Protection Rules
Branch protection rules are key components in branch access policies. They enforce specific conditions that must be met before changes can be made to protected branches. Common branch protection rules include:

### Requiring Pull Requests
Changes to a protected branch can only be made through pull requests (PRs), rather than direct pushes. This ensures that all changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

### Code Review Requirements
Specifies that a PR must be approved by one or more reviewers before it can be merged into the protected branch. This rule ensures that code quality and consistency are maintained.

### Status Checks
PRs must pass all required status checks before being merged. These checks could include automated tests, continuous integration (CI) checks, or security scans. This ensures that the code is stable and reliable.

### Require Signed Commits
Enforces that all commits to a protected branch must be signed with a valid GPG key. This rule ensures the authenticity of the code by verifying that it came from a trusted source.

### Prevent Force-Pushes
Force pushes allow a developer to overwrite the commit history of a branch, which can be dangerous. This rule prevents force pushes to protected branches, ensuring that the commit history remains intact and traceable.

### Prevent Branch Deletion
This rule prevents users from deleting a protected branch. Itâ€™s particularly useful for critical branches like main or production, where accidental deletions could disrupt the entire project.
