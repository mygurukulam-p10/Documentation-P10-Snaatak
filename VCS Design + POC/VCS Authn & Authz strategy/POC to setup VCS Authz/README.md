## Purpose
Authorization in version control systems (VCS) ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can modify or manage resources within a repository. This guide explains the various methods of authorization in Git-based systems (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), how to configure them, and best practices for maintaining secure access control to your repositories.

## Authorization Overview
Unlike authentication, which verifies user identity, authorization controls what actions a user can perform on a repository. Git-based VCS platforms provide a range of authorization mechanisms, including:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Defines roles such as admin, maintainer, and contributor.
- **Repository-Level Permissions** – Limits access to specific repositories within an organization or team.
- **Branch Protection** – Enforces rules on specific branches, such as restricting who can push or merge changes.

## System Prerequisites

| Requirements         | Recommendation                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| VCS Platform          | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket     |
| Git Version           | 2.28 or higher                |
| Admin or Maintainer Access | Required to manage roles and permissions |
| Branch Policies       | Enforced for critical branches like `main` |

## Authorization Methods in Git

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Uses predefined roles to manage permissions within a repository. Users are assigned roles like Admin, Maintainer, Developer, and Guest.

**Use Case**: Ideal for teams where distinct roles manage permissions across different repositories or projects.

### Repository-Level Permissions
Allows specific repositories to have unique permission settings. Individual users or teams can be granted read/write/maintain/admin access.

**Use Case**: For organizations with multiple repositories needing different permission structures for each repo.

### Branch Protection Rules
Protects critical branches by requiring reviews, disallowing force pushes, and enforcing commit signing.

**Use Case**: Essential for teams managing production code or sensitive projects with strict code integrity policies.

## Setting up Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is a fundamental way of managing access control in Git platforms. Here's how you can set it up on GitHub or GitLab:

1. **Assign Roles**:
   - In your Git repository, go to `Settings` > `Manage Access` and assign roles to users or teams. The common roles are:
     - **Admin**: Full control over the repository, including managing roles and repository settings.
     - **Maintainer**: Can manage repository content, but limited control over settings.
     - **Developer/Contributor**: Can create branches, commit, and make pull requests.
     - **Guest/Viewer**: Read-only access to the repository.
