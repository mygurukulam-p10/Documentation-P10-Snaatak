## Introduction

Authorization in Version Control Systems (VCS) controls user permissions, ensuring only authorized actions like reading, writing, or managing repositories. Common strategies include role-based access, branch protection, and pull request approvals, safeguarding the codebase by restricting critical changes to trusted users.

## Why we need Authorization

|    Reason    |    Explaination    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Security** | Protects the codebase from unauthorized changes. |
| **Integrity** | Maintains code quality by controlling who can make updates. |
| **Accountability** | Tracks who makes changes for auditing.|
| **Compliance** | Ensures access aligns with policies and regulations. |
| **Collaboration** | Facilitates teamwork with appropriate access levels. |



## Access levels in VCS authorization

|    Levels    |    Description    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Read-Only** | View and clone repositories. |
| **Write-Access** | Push changes and create branches.|
| **Admin** | Full control and configuration. |
| **Maintainer** | Manage branches and merge pull requests. |
| **Guest** | Limited, often read-only access. |



## Audit trails in VCS authorization

|    Audit Trail    |    Description    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Commits** | Records who made changes and what was changed. |
| **Pull Requests** | Tracks review and merge history.|
| **Access Changes** | Logs modifications to user permissions and roles. |
| **Branch Actions** | Details creation, deletion, and modifications of branches. |

## Integration with identity providers

|    Integration Type    |   Description    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **LDAP** | Connects to LDAP directories for user management and authentication. |
| **SAML** | Uses SAML for Single Sign-On (SSO) and federated access. |
| **OAuth** | Allows authentication and authorization through OAuth providers. |
| **Active Directory** | Integrates with Microsoft Active Directory for user and group management. |
| **Custom Providers** | Custom integrations with proprietary or specialized identity systems. |

## Conclusion

Effective VCS authorization is vital for securing code repositories and ensuring proper access control. By using strategies such as role-based access, branch protection, and pull request approvals, along with integration with identity providers, organizations can manage permissions, maintain code integrity, and support collaboration while ensuring compliance and accountability.
