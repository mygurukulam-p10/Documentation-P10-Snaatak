## Introduction

This document serves as a guide to understanding and implementing authorization methods within Version Control Systems (VCS), specifically focusing on Git. It outlines the importance of authorization, different access levels, and best practices for securing your codebase.

## Why we need Authorization

|    Reason    |    Explaination    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Security** | Protects the codebase from unauthorized changes. |
| **Integrity** | Maintains code quality by controlling who can make updates. |
| **Accountability** | Tracks who makes changes for auditing.|
| **Compliance** | Ensures access aligns with policies and regulations. |
| **Collaboration** | Facilitates teamwork with appropriate access levels. |


## Organization-Level Authorization

| Role/Integration    | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin Permissions**  | Full control over repositories, teams, members, and billing.                     |
| **Member Permissions** | Access to repositories and teams without admin control.                          |
 

## Role-based Authorization

|    Levels    |    Description    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Read-Only** | View and clone repositories. |
| **Write-Access** | Push changes and create branches.|
| **Admin** | Full control and configuration. |
| **Triage** | Manage issues and pull requests without write access to code.. |
| **Guest** | Limited, often read-only access. |


**Note-** We can Create seperate groups/teams for different departments and can add users to the teams and assign permissions at group level.

## Audit trails in VCS authorization

|    Audit Trail    |    Description    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Commits** | Records who made changes and what was changed. |
| **Pull Requests** | Tracks review and merge history.|
| **Access Changes** | Logs modifications to user permissions and roles. |
| **Branch Actions** | Tracks branch creation, deletion, and modifications of branches. |

## Best Practices 

| Best Practice                       | Explanation                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege Principle**       | Grant users only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.                     |
| **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**| Implement RBAC to assign permissions based on user roles and responsibilities.                 |
| **Regular Reviews**                 | Periodically review and update user permissions to ensure alignment with roles.                |
| **Strong Password Policies**        | Enforce strong password policies to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.            |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | Require 2FA for additional security, especially for high-privilege accounts.                   |
| **Audit Logs**                      | Regularly review audit logs to detect and respond to suspicious activity.                      |

## Conclusion

Effective VCS authorization is essential for safeguarding your codebase. By implementing role-based access, branch protection, and pull request reviews, you can ensure secure and controlled access, fostering collaboration while maintaining code integrity.
