### Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools for managing code changes and collaboration in software development projects. They track changes to files over time, allowing developers to work together efficiently and effectively.To ensure secure access and control over repositories, VCS platforms often implement various authentication mechanisms.

### Common VCS Authentication Methods

|      Method                |     Mechanism    |       Pros         |     Cons    |
|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Username and Password** | Users provide username and password | Simple setup, familiar to users | Less secure, risk of password theft |
|     **SSH Keys** | Generate public-private key pair | Secure, no password transmission | Complex setup, requires key management |
| **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**| Generate unique token for API access. | Convenient for automation, no credential sharing | Less secure if not managed well |
| **GPG Signing for Commit Verification** | Use GPG to digitally sign commits. | Ensures commit authenticity, prevents tampering | Requires GPG setup and key management |
