## Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools for managing code changes and collaboration in software development projects. They track changes to files over time, allowing developers to work together efficiently and effectively.To ensure secure access and control over repositories, VCS platforms often implement various authentication mechanisms.

## Why we need authentication

|    Reason    |    Explaination    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Prevents unauthorized access** | Restricts access to authorized users |
| **Maintains code integrity** | Prevents accidental or malicious changes |
| **Tracks changes** | Identifies who made specific changes
| **Protects sensitive information** | Safeguards sensitive data |
| **Complies with regulations** | Adheres to industry standards |



## Authentication Strategies in VCS

Git authentication has evolved from older methods like username/password (now deprecated) to more secure, modern options, including:-

**Username and Password -** Users enter their Username and Password to authenticate. This strategy is now deprecated for most of VCS service authentications.

**SSH Keys** - Secure key-based access.

**Personal Access Tokens (PAT) -** Token-based login for HTTPS with customizable permissions.



## Comparison between VCS Authentication Strategies
| **Method**                  | **Description**                    | **Security Level**           | **Use Case**            |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Username and Password (Deprecated)** | Deprecated due to security risks. |   Low  |   Avoid using   |
|    **SSH Key-Based Authentication**    | Secure key-pair system. |   High  | Recommended for personal and organizational repositories  |
|   **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**    |  Scoped tokens for HTTPS authentication. |  Medium to High  |   Required for HTTPS interactions.   |

## Common Authentication Errors and Solutions

|             **Error Message**           |           **Cause**                     |                 **Solution**                  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|   **Permission denied (publickey)**     |  SSH keys not correctly configured       |Ensure your public key is added to Git service.  |
|**fatal: Authentication failed for...**  |Incorrect credentials or token expired    |         Update credentials or regenerate PAT.   |

## Best Practices for VCS Authentication

**SSH keys**

|    Reason    |    Explaination    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Enhanced Security** | No password transmission over the network, reducing the risk of attacks. |
| **Automation** | Can be used for automated tasks, eliminating the need for manual password entry. |
| **Convenience** | Streamlines access to VCS repositories, saving time and effort. |
| **Granular Control** | Allows for fine-grained permissions for different users or teams. |
| **Integration with Other Tools** | Widely supported protocol, enabling seamless integration with various development tools. |

## Conclusion

Authentication in VCS ensures secure access to repositories using methods like SSH keys and Personal Access Tokens (PAT). With username/password authentication deprecated, modern methods like SSH and PATs offer stronger security.
