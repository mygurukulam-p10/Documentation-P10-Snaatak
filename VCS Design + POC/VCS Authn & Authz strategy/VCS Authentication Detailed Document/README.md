### Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools for managing code changes and collaboration in software development projects. They track changes to files over time, allowing developers to work together efficiently and effectively.To ensure secure access and control over repositories, VCS platforms often implement various authentication mechanisms.

### Why we need authentication


## Common VCS Authentication Srategies
| **Method**                  | **Description**                    | **Security Level**           | **Use Case**            |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Username and Password (Deprecated)** | Deprecated due to security risks. |   Low  |   Avoid using   |
