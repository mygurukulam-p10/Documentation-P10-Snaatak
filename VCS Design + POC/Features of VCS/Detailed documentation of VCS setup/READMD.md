## üß∞ Bitbucket Setup

**Bitbucket** by Atlassian is known for integrating well with tools like Jira and Trello. It allows you to manage Git repositories and collaborate on code.

### Steps to Set Up Bitbucket:
1. **Create an Account**: Go to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and sign up for a free account.
2. **Create a Repository**:
   - Click on **Repositories** in the top navigation bar.
   - Select **Create Repository**.
   - Choose a project name, repository name, and set it to **private** or **public**.
3. **Set Git Username and Email**:
    This configures Git to associate your commits with a username and email.
 ```
   git config --global user.name "brijsingh21"
   git config --global user.email "brij.singh.snaatak@mygurukulam.co"
   ```
4. **App Passwords**: Go to Personal settings > App passwords.

5. **Create App Password**: Click on Create app password, select the permissions you need (e.g., Repository - Read and Repository - Write), and generate the password. Copy it for later use.

6. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Once created, you will see the clone URL. Use the following Git command to clone it locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://<username>:<app_password>@bitbucket.org/<username>/<repository>.git
     ```
6. **Push Your Code**:
   - After making changes, use the following commands to push your code:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main
     ```

7. **Collaborate**: Invite team members by going to the repository settings and selecting **User and Group Access**.

## üêô GitHub Setup

**GitHub** is one of the most popular Git hosting platforms used by millions of developers and open-source projects.

### Steps to Set Up GitHub:
1. **Create an Account**: Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up.
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the **New** button in the repositories section.
   - Add a **repository name**, select public or private, and optionally add a README.

3. **Access Tokens**: Navigate to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens.

4. **Generate Token**: Click on Generate new token. Select the scopes you need (e.g., repo for full control of private repositories) and generate the token. Make sure to copy it, as you won't be able to see it again.

5. **Set Git Username and Email**:
    This configures Git to associate your commits with a username and email.
 ```
   git config --global user.name "brijsingh21"
   git config --global user.email "brij.singh.snaatak@mygurukulam.co"
   ```
6. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Copy the HTTPS or SSH link and clone it:
 ```bash
     git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```
7. **Push Your Code**:
   - After making changes, push your code with the following commands:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Collaborate**: To collaborate, go to **Settings > Manage access** and invite your team.

## ü¶ä GitLab Setup

**GitLab** offers a full DevOps platform, including Git repository hosting, CI/CD, and security scanning tools.

### Steps to Set Up GitLab:
1. **Sign Up**: Head to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and create an account.
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Go to the **Projects** tab and click **New Project**.
   - Choose between creating a **blank project**, importing an existing one, or using a template.
3.**Access Tokens**: Go to User Settings > Access Tokens.

5. **Set Git Username and Email**:
    This configures Git to associate your commits with a username and email.
 ```
   git config --global user.name "brijsingh21"
   git config --global user.email "brij.singh.snaatak@mygurukulam.co"
   ```
6. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Once the repository is created, clone it using the following Git command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@gitlab.com/<username>/<repository>.git
     ```
7. **Push Your Code**:
   - Use the following Git commands to push code:
     ```bash
     git add .
