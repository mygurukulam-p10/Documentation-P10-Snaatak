Monitoring
Monitoring in DevOps refers to the practice of continuously observing and collecting data from various components of an application or system to ensure its health, performance, and availability. It involves tracking various metrics, events, and logs to identify issues, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of the DevOps lifecycle as it helps teams proactively manage and maintain their applications, enabling faster response to problems and better overall system performance.

Metrics
Parameter	Description	Priority	Threshold
Disk Utilization	The percentage of disk space used by the application.	High	>90%
Availability	The percentage of time the application is available.	High	>= 99.9%
Memory Utilization	The percentage of memory used by the application.	Medium	>80%
CPU Utilization	The percentage of CPU time used by the application.	Medium	>70%
Network Traffic	The amount of network traffic generated by the application.	Medium	Varies based on use case
Latency	The time taken for the application to respond to a request.	High	< 300ms
Errors	The number of errors generated by the application.	High	> 5 per minute
Throughput	The number of requests the application can handle per unit of time.	High	> 1000 requests per minute
Security	The security of the application (authentication, authorization, encryption).	High	Continuous monitoring
Health check
Name	Type	InitialDelaySeconds	PeriodSeconds	TimeoutSeconds	SuccessThreshold	FailureThreshold
App name	ReadinessProbe	10	10	5	1	3
App name	LivenessProbe	10	10	-	5	1
Explanation of parameters used in above table
Parameter	Description
ReadinessProbe	This probe checks if the application is ready to receive traffic.
LivenessProbe	This probe checks if the application is still running and responding to requests.
InitialDelaySeconds	The number of seconds to wait before the first health check is performed.
PeriodSeconds	The frequency at which the health check should be performed.
TimeoutSeconds	The maximum amount of time that the health check should wait for a response before it considers the application unhealthy.
SuccessThreshold	The number of consecutive successful health checks before the application is considered healthy.
FailureThreshold	The number of consecutive unhealthy health checks before the application is considered unhealthy.
Logging
This offers all types of logs related to the application like: Event Logs, Server Logs, System Logs, Authorization and Access Logs, Change Logs, Availability Logs, Resource Logs, Threat Logs

Event Logs	Description
location/to/event.log	An event log is a high-level log that records network traffic and usage data such as incorrect password attempts, login attempts, and application events.
Authentication & Authorization Logs	Description
location/to/access.log	Authorization and access logs contain a list of persons or bots who have accessed specific programs or files.
Server Logs	Description
location/to/server.log	A server log is a text document that keeps track of actions on a certain server over some time.
Threat Logs	Description
location/to/threat.log	Threat logs are logs that contain information on the system, file, or application traffic that matches a firewall's security profile.
Disaster Recovery
In the event of a disaster affecting the application's functionality, it's important to have a robust disaster recovery plan in place. It typically ensures that critical systems and data can be restored after a disaster.

Disaster could be caused by a natural disaster, a cyberattack, or other event that takes down your IT infrastructure.

High Availability
Ensuring high availability of the application is crucial to minimize downtime and provide seamless service to users. High Availability is a design approach that minimizes downtime for critical systems and services. This is achieved by deploying redundant components and systems, so that if one component fails, another can take over.

Note: In other words, DR is focused on recovering from a disaster, while HA is focused on preventing downtime.

Troubleshooting
Mention all the common issues that you encountered while performing setup of the Application. If you think there are some specific errors that are seen, you can add their screenshots or give a brief explanation of issue and offer solution to resolve it or guide the user to troubleshoot easily.
