# Introduction
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control using Git, along with a suite of collaborative features for software development. It has become an essential tool in the software development lifecycle, allowing developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage code efficiently. GitHub offers a cloud-based infrastructure where users can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.

**Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle** : GitHub plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle by enabling distributed teams to work together on the same codebase. It ensures that all changes are tracked, versioned, and can be reverted if necessary. With GitHub, teams can:

- **Collaborate seamlessly**: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

- **Maintain a history of changes**: Every change made to the codebase is logged, allowing developers to see what was changed, when, and by whom.

- **Facilitate code reviews**: Pull requests allow developers to propose changes to a codebase, which can be reviewed and discussed before being merged.

- **Automate workflows**: GitHub integrates with various CI/CD tools to automate testing, deployment, and other processes.

# Key Concept

## Repositories: 
A repository (repo) is the central place where all the files for a particular project are stored. It contains the project’s codebase, along with all the historical versions of the files, organized in a directory structure. Repositories can be public, where anyone can view the code, or private, where only authorized users have access.

- **Local Repository**: A version of the repository that is stored on your local machine.
- **Remote Repository**: A version of the repository that is hosted on GitHub or another Git server.

## Branches: 
Branches are a fundamental feature in Git that allows developers to create separate lines of development within the same repository. A branch is essentially a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit.

- **Main Branch (main or master)**: This is the default branch where the final version of the code resides.
- **Feature Branches**: These are branches created from the main branch to work on new features, bug fixes, or other tasks without affecting the main branch.
- **Branching Workflow**: Developers create a new branch for each task or feature, work on it independently, and then merge it back into the main branch once the task is complete.

## Commits: 
A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. It represents a set of changes that have been made to the codebase. Each commit contains:

- **A unique identifier (hash)**: This uniquely identifies the commit and can be used to reference it in the future.
- **Author information**: Who made the changes.
- **Commit message**: A brief description of what changes were made and why.
- **Changes**: The actual changes made to the files in the repository.

 Commits are the building blocks of a project’s history, allowing developers to track progress and revert to previous states if needed.

## Pull Requests: 
A pull request (PR) is a feature that allows developers to notify team members that they have completed a feature or a set of changes and would like those changes to be merged into the main branch. The process typically involves:

- **Creating a pull request**: After pushing commits to a branch, a developer creates a PR, summarizing the changes and their purpose.
- **Reviewing**: Team members review the PR, providing feedback, requesting changes, or approving it.
- **Merging**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged into the main branch, integrating the new changes into the codebase.

Pull requests are a critical part of the collaboration process, enabling code reviews, discussions, and quality control before new code is integrated into the main project.

# Repositories

## Creating a Repository

A GitHub repository is essentially a storage space for your project, where you can keep track of all the files and changes. Here’s how to create a repository with the necessary components.

### Steps to Create a New Repository

**1. Log in to GitHub**:
- Go to GitHub and log in with your credentials.

**2. Navigate to Your Profile**:
- Click on your profile icon in the top right corner and select ```Your repositories``` from the dropdown menu.

**3. Create a New Repository**:
- Click the ```New``` button (usually in green) on the repositories page, or you can directly go to GitHub's new repository page.

**4. Fill in Repository Details**:
- **Repository Name**: Provide a unique name for your repository. This name will be used in the repository’s URL.
- **Description (optional)**: Write a short description of your project. This is helpful for others to understand the purpose of the repository.

**5. Initialize with README**:
- Check the box that says “Initialize this repository with a README.”
- A README file provides an overview of your project. It’s the first file people see when they visit your repository.

**6.Add a License**:
- Choose a license for your repository from the “Add a license” dropdown. The license determines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Common licenses include MIT, GPL, and Apache 2.0.

**7. Choose Repository Visibility**:
- **Public**: Anyone on the internet can see this repository. You choose who can commit.
- **Private**: You choose who can see and commit to this repository.

**8. Create the Repository**:
- Once everything is set, click the Create repository button.

### Creating a Repository Locally and Pushing to GitHub
**1. Create a Local Repository**:
```
mkdir my-repo
cd my-repo
git init
```
**2. Create a README File**:
```
echo "# My Repository" > README.md
```
**3. Commit Initial Files**:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

# Branches
## 1. Branching Strategy

**Branches in GitHub**

Branches in GitHub are a way to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main codebase. Each branch is essentially a copy of the codebase at the point when the branch was created.

- i. Default Branch (main/master):
   - The default branch is the main branch where the source code of the HEAD is located. This is often named ```main``` (previously ```master``` was the convention).
   -  It's the primary branch where the final and stable version of your code lives.
   -  Other branches (feature, hotfix, etc.) are usually merged into this branch after they have been reviewed and tested.

- ii. Feature Branches:
  - Feature branches are created from the default branch (main or master) to develop new features, fix bugs, or do any experimental work.
  - These branches allow developers to work in isolation from the main codebase. When the work is completed, the branch is merged back into the main branch.

## 2. Creating and Managing Branches

**Creating a New Branch**

To create a new branch, use the ```git branch``` command followed by the branch name. You can also switch to the new branch immediately using ```git checkout``` or ```git switch```.

```
# Create a new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Or using the new syntax (Git 2.23 and above)
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

**Switching Between Branches**

To switch between branches, you can use the ```git checkout``` or ```git switch``` command:

```
# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Or using the new syntax
git switch <branch-name>
```

**Deleting Branches**

Once a branch is no longer needed, you can delete it to keep your repository clean. This can be done with the ```-d``` (delete) or ```-D``` (force delete) flag.

```
# Delete a branch locally
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Force delete a branch (useful if the branch is not fully merged)
git branch -D <branch-name>

# Delete a branch remotely
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```
# Issues 
## Creating and Managing Issues

GitHub Issues is a powerful tool for tracking bugs, enhancements, tasks, and more. Here's how you can create and manage issues effectively:

**Creating an Issue**
1. G**o to the Issues Tab**: Navigate to the repository where you want to create an issue. Click on the "Issues" tab.
2. **Click on "New Issue"**: You'll see a green button labeled "New Issue." Click on it.
3. **Fill Out the Issue Details**:

- **Title**: Provide a concise title for the issue.
- **Description**: Give a detailed description of the issue. You can use Markdown for formatting.
- **Assignees**: Assign the issue to one or more team members by clicking on the "Assignees" section and selecting from the list.
- **Labels**: Add labels to categorize the issue. Click on "Labels" and select relevant ones.
- **Milestone**: If applicable, link the issue to a milestone by selecting one from the "Milestone" dropdown.
- **Projects**: Link the issue to a project board by selecting the appropriate project.

4. **Submit the Issue**: Once you have filled out all the details, click on the "Submit new issue" button.

# GitHub Actions
