# **Monorepo vs Micro Repo**

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive understanding of **Monorepo** and **Micro Repo** approaches in software development. This includes an introduction to both models, a comparison table highlighting their key differences, and a conclusion that helps teams choose the right strategy based on their needs. This document aims to guide organizations in adopting the most suitable repository management style for their software development lifecycle.

## **Introduction**

### **Monorepo**
A **Monorepo** (short for **monolithic repository**) is a version control strategy where multiple projects, services, or components are managed within a single repository. This approach enables large-scale collaboration, shared code management, and streamlined dependency handling. Companies like **Google**, **Microsoft**, and **Facebook** widely adopt Monorepos to simplify collaboration across large, complex software ecosystems.

### **Micro Repo**
A **Micro Repo** is a version control strategy where each project or component is maintained in its **own separate repository**. This approach is ideal for small, independent services or projects that benefit from isolated codebases. Micro Repos provide greater autonomy to teams, allowing them to work independently without the overhead of a large shared codebase.

## **Comparison: Monorepo vs Micro Repo**

| **Aspect**                  | **Monorepo**                                                                                             | **Micro Repo**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**               | A single repository that houses multiple projects, services, or components.                             | Multiple repositories, each dedicated to a single project or service.                               |
| **Codebase Size**            | Large codebase with multiple projects in one repository.                                                 | Smaller codebases, with each repo focused on a single project or service.                           |
| **Collaboration**            | Easier for teams to collaborate on shared projects due to centralized code management.                   | Teams work independently on separate projects, leading to more autonomy.                            |
| **Dependency Management**    | Internal dependencies managed within the repository; easier to track shared libraries.                   | Dependencies are isolated to each repo, which may lead to duplications or complex management.        |
| **Version Control**          | Unified versioning across all projects, simplifying release coordination.                               | Independent versioning for each repo; better for isolated projects but harder to sync versions.      |
| **Scalability**              | Can become hard to scale and maintain as the codebase grows larger.                                      | Scales more easily due to smaller, more manageable codebases.                                        |
| **Refactoring**              | Easier to refactor shared code across projects since everything is in one place.                         | Refactoring across repositories is more complex and requires coordination between repos.             |
| **Testing and CI/CD**        | Centralized testing and CI/CD pipelines for all projects; easier to integrate testing tools.             | Independent testing and CI/CD pipelines; better for isolated development, but setup may be redundant.|
| **Tooling Requirements**     | May require specialized tooling (e.g., **Bazel**, **Nx**, **Lerna**) to handle large repositories.       | Fewer complex tools required, though managing many small repos may need lightweight automation.      |
| **Permissions Management**   | Difficult to manage fine-grained access control in large repositories.                                  | Easier to manage permissions, as each repo has fewer contributors and more specific access needs.    |
| **Merge Conflicts**          | Higher risk of merge conflicts due to multiple teams working in the same repository.                     | Fewer conflicts, as teams work on independent repositories with less overlap in code changes.        |
| **Consistency**              | Easier to maintain consistency in coding standards, libraries, and tools across projects.                | Harder to enforce consistent standards and libraries across multiple repositories.                   |
| **Build Time**               | Longer build times due to the size and complexity of the repository.                                     | Shorter build times as each repository is smaller and more focused.                                  |
| **Complexity**               | Complexity increases as the size of the repository grows, making it harder to manage without tooling.    | Simpler to manage individual repos, but coordinating across multiple repos adds some complexity.     |

## **Conclusion**
When choosing between a **Monorepo** and a **Micro Repo** strategy, teams must consider the **size**, **complexity**, and **collaboration needs** of their projects.

- **Monorepo** is ideal for **large-scale organizations** with **interdependent projects** that need to work together in a unified repository. It provides better **collaboration** and **dependency management** but comes with challenges in terms of **scalability** and **tooling**.
  
- **Micro Repo**, on the other hand, works best for teams that prefer **independence** in their projects, have **small, decoupled services**, and want **faster development cycles** with isolated codebases. However, managing multiple repos may lead to **complex dependencies** and **consistency challenges**.
